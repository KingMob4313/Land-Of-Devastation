&9|Combat Mode Selection|~
&9---------------------||~
&BLOD Offers several different "combat modes". These different modes allow you to|~
&Bchoose a method of combat that you like. The combat modes are used for close|~
&Brange combat (i.e. hand-to-hand). The default mode is statistical, but feel|~
&Bfree to select whichever mode you prefer.||~

&9|Statistical Combat|~
&9------------------||~
&BIn statistical based combat, your odds of hitting the monster will depend|~
&Bon your numerical stats (i.e. Strength, dexterity, agility) and not on any|~
&Bother skill.|~
~
~
~
&9|Alpha Combat|~
&9------------||~
&BIn alpha combat, your chances of hitting the hostile monster are base on how|~
&Bfast you can hit a specific key on the keyboard. In effect, this method tests|~
&Byour typing skills. If your stats are low and you are a good typist, you may|~
&Bwish to give this method a shot.|~
~
~
&9|Reflex Combat|~
&9-------------||~
&BIn reflex based combat, your chances of hitting the monster are based on your|~
&Breflexes. A number sequence will be presented and when you see a pre-determined|~
&Bnumber, hit your enter key. If you hit it fast enough, then you will hit the|~
&Bmonster.|~

&E|You reach over and press the lever that activates the teleportation chamber.|~
&EImmediately, you are surrounded by a thick black mist. You can feel the energy|~
&Ebuild as the teleporter's capacitors are charging. One sudden burst and your|~
&Ebody has been changed from matter to energy. A transmission dish on the roof of|~
&Ethe fortress turns in the direction of the target fortress. A second later, a|~
&Ebright beam of energy streaks across the sky to the target fortress. Your|~
&Eenergy is then captured and reconstructed into your proper form. You have been|~
&Eteleported!|~
~
~

&Erecharger closer to your armor. Lightning like flashes of energy burst from the|~
&Erecharger and impact into your armor. As you peer into the inferno, you can see|~
&Ethat the molecular structure of your armor is being regenerated right before|~
&Eyour eyes. A few more minutes, and your armor has regained it's full strength!|~

&7game. Hours go by like minutes as you move the colored blocks across the screen|~

&7astonishing. By playing the game, you increased your hand-eye coordination,|~
&7resulting in a gain of 4 dexterity points!|~

&2|The Technician explains the process: "Recently, a device was invented called|~
&2the fortress SFG. It enables a fortress to be invisible to all but the map|~
&2square it is located in. This can be troublesome to those who are attempting|~
&2to locate a certain fort. We have built this upgrade for the Standard JC137|~
&2scanner (available at Sacre Base) to overcome this problem. Our upgrade will|~
&2allow the scanner to display a bearing to any cloaked forts within it's range."|~
|&BHave the technician work on which device (&F?&B=List,&FQ&B=Quit) ? &F~
|&CThe technician looks confused...|~
|&CThat device is not a scanner.|~

&2|The technician installs the conversion on your scanner and hands it back to|~
&2you.|~
|&CThat device already has the conversion installed!|~
&2|The technician gets out his armor-conversion manual and explains the options|~
&2to you: "Our Exoskeleton Augmentation conversion reinforces your armor with a|~
&2a polymer material several times harder than steel and installs hydraulic|~
&2strength enhancement cylinders to boost your strength. We can perform the|~
&2following enhancements: 10%: &F$~
&2, 20%: &F$~
&2, and 30%: &F$~

&2|The technician gets out his armor-conversion manual and explains the options|~
&2to you: "Our Targetting Array includes an optical unit which sits just in front|~
&2of your right eye. Sensors are placed in the armor so that as you move your|~
&2body, the optical display updates automatically thus increasing your dexterity|~
&2substantially. We make a variety of upgrades and can offer the following|~
&2enhancements: 10% &F$~

|&CYour weapon already has a shockwave blaster installed.|~
|&2"The shockwave blaster is a specialty modification which will send precisely|~
&2calculated burst of high frequency energy in the direction of your opponent.|~
&2The power of this blast is sufficient to literally send items flying from your|~
&2opponent's hands! My price for this service is &F$~

|&BInstall a shockwave blaster on your weapon (&FY&B/&FN&B) ? ~
|&2The weaponsmith retrieves a preassembled shockwave blaster module from his|~
&2parts bin and proceeds to work it into your weapon. The task is long and|~
&2quite laborous, but undoubtably well worth it.|~
|&CYour weapon already has a grenade lancher installed.|~
|&2"This modification will install a grenade launching tube on your long range|~
&2weapon. As long as you are carrying grenades, your LR weapon will fire both|~
&2it's normal blast as well as a grenade. Grenade hits are guarenteed, but due|~
&2to the bulk of the launcher, your normal LR shots may suffer an accuracy|~
&2penalty. My price for this service is &F$~

|&BInstall a grenade launcher on your weapon (&FY&B/&FN&B) ? ~
|&2The weaponsmith locates an MKL-29TU grenade launching assembly from his supply|~
&2rack and welds it onto the underside of your LR weapon. A rather crude and|~
&2bulky modification, but it ought to work.|~
&2This operation is for short range weapons only. Let's have a look....|~
|&CYour weapon already has an armor burner modification installed.|~
|&2"The armor burner will enable your SR weapon to do enhanced damage when you|~
&2hit your opponent's armor. Damage during other phases of combat is not|~
&2affected by the armor burner unit. We have several levels of armor burner|~
&2modules available: ||~

&2examines it closely for possible defects, and proceeds to install it into|~
&2your weapon. "There! You're all set now. ", proclaims the weaponsmith.|~
|&CYour weapon already has a deathpulse module installed.|~
|&2"Our deathpulse module will enable you to channel a massive energy burst|~
&2through your short range weapon. This energy burst can do between &F~
&2 and &F~

&2that your weapon will be damaged by the power levels involved with this|~
&2modification. My price is &F$~

|&BInstall a deathpulse module on your weapon (&FY&B/&FN&B) ? ~
|&2The weaponsmith replaces the energy charging unit in your weapon with|~
