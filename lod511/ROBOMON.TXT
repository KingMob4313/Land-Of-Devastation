KILLHIM Your final blow disables the robomine. It's wrecked frame falls
KILLHIM to the ground, lifeless. You think to yourself "I wonder how much
KILLHIM money the owner wasted on this piece of junk!"

FLEETXT You run from the situation as fast as you can. The Robomine
FLEETXT returns to its bunker to recharge for the next attack.

NAME Robomine Mark 3

DESC Though your ears still ring from the explosion, you can just make
DESC out the scraping of a steel hinge. Suddenly a metallic form bursts
DESC from the fire, its twin gravity projectors trained on you and its
DESC spindly legs clicking against the scorched earth. The Robomine Mark
DESC III is primed and ready for battle.

KILLHIM Its structural integrity compromised, the Robomine seems to
KILLHIM collapse in upon itself. One of the problems with gravity based
KILLHIM power plants you suppose.

FLEETXT Glancing back, you can see a small bunker rise from the ground
FLEETXT to accept the Robomine for recharging and maintenance.

NAME Robomine Mark 4

DESC A cloud of dust erupts as a large object falls from above,
DESC apparently shot into the air by the force of the explosion. Quickly
DESC regaining its footing on 6 segmented legs, the metal monstrosity
DESC arches a scorpion-like tail (likely a weapon mount) over its frame.

KILLHIM Volatile gasses hiss from the shattered frame of the Robomine
KILLHIM Mark IV. Its days as an assassin are over.

FLEETXT From an outcropping reached in your panic, you watch the Robomine
FLEETXT Mark IV position and then bury itself above the site of the mine.

NAME Robomine Mark 5

DESC Having used the force of the explosion to shoot several meters
DESC through the ground, the Robomine Mark V rises from the earth in a
DESC perfect spot to blast with the twin scaled-down tachyon blasters on
DESC either side of its 'mouth.' That's of course if it doesn't just rip
DESC you with the Widow Lance integrated into the tail.

NAME Robomine Mark 6

DESC You leap as several razor sharp tentacles burst from the smoldering

DESC a Robomine Mark VI, which can tunnel as fast as you can walk.

NAME Guardian Mark 6

DESC beneath them bulging from the rounded frame of the Guardian Mark VI

KILLHIM The power of the blow actually lifts the hull of the Guardian
KILLHIM right out of the ground. It looks much like an egg with tentacles
KILLHIM spread over it. Well, a broken egg now.

FLEETXT A shower of dust sprays into the air as the Guardian tunnels
FLEETXT straight down, no doubt to prepare for its next encounter.

KILLHIM Though the Draku RCU (Robotic Combat Unit) Mark IV is a fine
KILLHIM example of engineering skill, its still no match for the
KILLHIM determination of a single human.

FLEETXT The Draku RCU Mark IV casually leaps into the nearby blast hole,
FLEETXT secure in its place as a marvel of engineering.

NAME Xeboc RCU Mk 6

DESC The ground quakes beneath you, emitting the sound of grinding ...
DESC metal? Rolling out of the way you manage to dodge the slashing rakes
DESC of a dozen glowing blades, each fixed to the head of a gleaming
DESC tentacle. A sensor pod slowly rises from amongst them, glaring at
DESC you with the menace only a Xeboc RCU (Robotic Combat unit) Mark VI
DESC can generate. Money is apparently no object for somebody out there.

KILLHIM You inhale hard as the ultimate in robomine technology is added
KILLHIM to the list of the vanquished. Whoever set this thing has just
KILLHIM wasted a great deal of money, and made a very dangerous enemy.

FLEETXT There is a horrible grinding of metal as the Xeboc RCU sinks
FLEETXT slowly into the wasteland sands. You are safe: For now.
