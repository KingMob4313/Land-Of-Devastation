DESC what part has to be taken for the ship for the puriton you
DESC think that maybe talking to the ship through the terminal
DESC might be best.

;       monster who is guarding the Crashed ship

NAME Xeboc

NAME Xeboc

DESC Well human, it seems I have underestimated you. I had figured my minions

KILLHIM Your final blow nearly rips Xeboc in half. "Save me!" he cries, but
KILLHIM no one is there to listen. "My cabal warriors! Come to my defense!".
KILLHIM His words are not heard. You prepare to deal the blow of death to
KILLHIM your mortal enemy, Xeboc. His bloody mutilated body lays before you,
KILLHIM defenseless. "Now you're time has come, Xeboc. You will trouble the
KILLHIM planet earth no more..." you say as you raise your weapon. You strike.
KILLHIM As the metal from your weapon glazes Xeboc's body, his body vanishes!
KILLHIM Xeboc has escaped! As you prepare to leave the building, a voice
KILLHIM comes across the speaker: "Mortal, .... Who do you think is president
KILLHIM of Acme weapons? And creator of the EM-WARP device? HAHAHAHA! I'll
KILLHIM be back.... with a fleet of 30,000 cabal warships!"

FLEETXT Well, Xeboc the almighty, leader of the cabal forces, initiator of the
FLEETXT great war, invader of earth, etc, etc. seems a bit too tough to handle
FLEETXT at this moment so you turn around and run. You don't look back until
FLEETXT you are very far from xeboc's hideout.

NAME Vayderr

DESC "So, ObiWan has sent someone to oppose me. You must know that the Dark
DESC side is all powerful - you can not win." Vayderr waves his hand... There
DESC is a brilliant flash followed by a moment of darkness. You notice several
DESC of your possessions have disappeared! "Hahahaha Human, you are in my
DESC reality now... Prepare to be DESTROYED!"

NAME Sub-Patriarch

DESC 'Let the challenge begin.' says the monotone voice from the speaker as
DESC a section of wall slides open to reveal a figure in red and black
DESC robes.  The Sub-Patriarch of Loki floats forward from the shadows.  A
DESC horror to behold, he has given up most of his humanity for the power
DESC of mechanical augmentation.  Lights begin to flash on the virtual
DESC cannon that replaces his right forearm, and you can hear the
DESC mechanical grinding that serves as a voice, "Now, follower of order,
DESC we will see which of our respective philosophies is the stronger."

KILLHIM Sparks fly across the room as your weapon rips through the belly of
KILLHIM the Sub-Patriarch.  He slams into the wall, leaking hydraulic fluid
KILLHIM as his mechanical joints squeal from the tremendous damage they've
KILLHIM taken.  He is only able to utter the words "Chaos claims its own"
KILLHIM before the systems completely fail and the red glow of his visual
KILLHIM sensors fades.

FLEETXT Unable to face the full capabilities of a the Loki cyborg, you bolt
FLEETXT from the chamber, almost falling off the cloud in the process.  You
FLEETXT hear a disappointed sigh from the computer, which transports you
FLEETXT back to the surface.

NAME Serpine Chief

DESC Seconds after you enter the camp you find yourself surrounded by a
DESC dozen heavily armed Serpine.  They stare at you with emotionless
DESC reptilian eyes, and you get the distinct impression you aren't
DESC welcome.  Suddenly they part to reveal a huge, green, hissing form.
DESC The Serpine Chief's weary eyes are hazy and glossed, its scales dull
DESC in both color and form. But apparent age is contradicted by smooth,
DESC swift motion.  It regards you with a scholarly look as its translator
DESC activates: "Sso human. You have at lasst come to keel me." It speaks
DESC deliberately to decrease the effect of its sibilant hissing. "But
DESC perhaps first we talk?"  He leads you into a small hide tent.  It is
DESC filled with trophies of battle, ancient human artworks long thought
DESC destroyed, and in the corner the Puritron Rad Converter hums softly as
DESC it fills a weapon clip with energy.  The Chief observes your surprise
DESC with satisfaction.

COMBATPIC SERPNCHF

KILLHIM The serpine chief falls gurgling against the Rad Converter and
KILLHIM speaks, near incoherent from pain, "Make lannd fit for both
KILLHIM sspeccies, sso peacce betweeen mmaybe occurss. Taake art too, lesst
KILLHIM ssuccessorss desstroy. If could only have given iit alll to you in
KILLHIM peacce, without loosst honor..." He collapses in pain, but rises
KILLHIM pointing to the gathering pool on the floor "Lasst......Sserpiine
KILLHIM cosstum. Pleesse. Take mee with yoou..." His eyes let you at once
KILLHIM understand. Lifting his blood from the floor with cupped hands, you
KILLHIM drink the sweet liquid and watch the Serpine nod and die content;
KILLHIM Wherever your hunt leads, he will always be a part of it.

FLEETXT You turn and shoot out of the tent, racing past the Serpines
FLEETXT gathered outside, into the wasteland.  Eventually you get to safety
FLEETXT and begin to wonder: He seemed so fast, how could you have escaped
FLEETXT unless...unless...He let you.
