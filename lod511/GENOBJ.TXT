TAG 0

FOOTER
You switch on the Communicator, and immediately the sound of idle chatter
is heard through the speaker.  It seems that the Ronin use these things
to communicate with their home base and each other.  Curious to what they
are talking about, you listen in... Suddenly it becomes clear that there
a large number of Ronin from what it sounds, for there are at least eight
difference voices that you can identify.

   "We're not thieves, not murderers..."  
   "...We just take what we can and help them."
 "Great, morals from a blues guitarist."

RANDOM
"The Israeli weapons are just amazing."
 "Go to hell man, nothing beats a good German Pistol."
"Yeah, I'm talking full-Auto's here.  The Israeli Uzi and Galil rock!"

RANDOM
"Wonderful, I love waking up with sand in my ears"
   "You camping out there Les?"
"It's too far to walk back some nights?"

  "What you talking about, Kurt?"
"I was following some large tank treads for- <Static>"
     "Kurt, Kurt, you're breaking up!"
"Damn, it disappeared.  It looked like Terra Labs."
   "Terra Labs?"
     "The Sacre base men said it was a mobile pre-war factory."

"Shut up Derrick, you're just happy that you got the Pulse Laser."
  "Hey man, it's my week to patrol sector 11."
"I know, we're getting dangerously low on energy clips."
     "And I can't modify the feeds for our weapons fast enough."
 "We'll discuss this later, just stay cool out there."

This is a set of tools designed for working with electronic devices. It can
perform a variety of functions, including retuning communications devices of
all sorts.

CONVERT Chaos Medallion > Loki Summoner
Using the tools, you disassemble the Chaos Medallion and locate the circuitry
that is used for transmission. Enabling the circuitry is a simple task which
you perform effortlessly. Reassembled, the unit is now ready for use.

CONVERT Ghetto Blaster > Radio
You skillfully disassemble the Ghetto Blaster with the tools and begin to
muck around with it's circuitry.  After a while you figure it out and its 
now a working Radio.

You reconsider your action and figure that this device probably only functions
in the wastelands.

There is a very large dark cloud hovering over your current position. I would
guess there are better things you should be doing now than fooling around
with some gadget.

IFTESTZ 1
IFTERRAIN Comm Tower
DOSPECIAL LOKI
DOQUEST 16
HEADER
Patching the Loki Summoner through the tower, you attempt to transmit a signal
to the origination source of the Loki Messages. The communications tower locks
on to the source of the signals, but the information is confusing - It seems
to indicate a source miles above the ground and approaching very fast. As
you attempt to decipher this information, an ominous dark cloud fills the
sky and an energy beam is directed towards the gound.
~
A loud voice booms "Step into the light!".

IFTESTZ 1
IFNTERRAIN Comm Tower
IFNTERRAIN Loki City
HEADER
You attempt to use the transmitter device to send a message to the Lokis.
Unfortunately, it seems the range of this device by itself is quite limited.
What is needed is a large signal boost... If used in the close proximity of
some sort of communication tower, then you may obtain better results.

HEADER
As you blow on the whistle, you notice the movement of Serpine warriors
throught the trees that surround you. Perhaps it is time to visit them???

IFTESTZ 1
IFTERRAIN Desert
DOSPECIAL SERPINE
HEADER
You blow through the whistle. Although you hear nothing, you suspect it is
due to the high-frequency nature of the whistle. After waiting several hours,
you are nearly ready to give up as you notice movement in the surrounding
burush. It appears that you are surrounded by a rather sizeable Serpine war
party.

IFTESTZ 1
IFNTERRAIN Desert
IFNTERRAIN Serp Camp
HEADER
You blow on the whistle and wait several hours, but there is no response.
Perhaps the Serpine do not regularly inhabit this area. It is common knowledge
that the serpine are desert dwellers. Perhaps searching in the deserts would
make more sense?
