#TAV1 Defs Sacre
!Howdy there. Name's Defs Sacre. I used to be a warrior, but now I've retired
!and serve as bartender here at the base. I know lots about monsters, armor,
!weapons, elementals, etc. I'm also quite knowledgable about Sacre Base
!itself. What you want to know about?
*NAME
+Name's Defs Sacre, like I said.
*JOB
+I'm just bartender here. I used to be a wasteland warrior, but I'm now
+retired. I know about lots of things though.
*BAR
+Would you like a drink?
*DRINK
+Here you go.... One soda!
%GIVEITEM SODA
*WARRIOR
+I used to be quite a warrior before I retired. In fact, it was I who
+discovered Terra Labs.
*TERRA
+Terra Labs was a fairly advanced pre-war weapons factory. It was abandoned
+when I and my companions located it, but as soon as we had time to explore
+it, we discovered machinery to craft many of the weapons you see around the
+base - electroblades, electrolances, etc. Troy and I moved most of the
+factory equipment here, to Sacre Base, before the accident.
*ACCIDENT
+A few of our 'techs were working on matter warping technology at Terra Labs.
+The last thing I saw was them running out the entrance, and then Terra Labs
+vanished!
*VANISHED
+Poof! It vanished into thin air. Nobody knows what happened. A few patrols
+said they saw it in zone two, but we investigated and found nothing. Then
+one of our Sergeants claimed to have encountered it in zone 5, but again,
+nothing. It's a real mystery.
*BASE
+Ah yes, this base.  It's a marvel of techology.  Modelled off the Bio-
+Sphere Project that they ran near the end of century.  The dome keeps
+the Radiation out, and the fauna provides for 70% of the oxygen.
*DEATH
+Ah yes, the Death Warriors. They're a nasty bunch. Rumor has it they have a
+city down the main highway to the south. I've known a couple of guys who
+attempted to get inside, but they never returned. Seems to me the only way
+to get in would be to find some way to trick them into thinking you were one
+of them.
*WEAPON
+I know lots about weapons. What do you want to know about? Short range or
+long range weapons? I also have used some grenades in my time.
*SHORT
+There are lots of short range weapons. My favorite is the Adamantium Sword.
+There is a couple different Adamantium weapons they don't sell them around
+here - Someone found me one out in zone 4 lying in the sand.  Supposedly,
+some of the Ronin out there use them.
*LONG
+I prefer to use a gravblaster. The ammo for em is damn expensive, but they
+really trash whoever you're fighting.
*GRENADE
+Grenades are one of my favorites. The explosion is so large, you have
+a much better chance of hitting something than you have with a ranged weapon.
+Back in my fightin' days, I used to carry around a grenade pack or two.
+Run into something nasty like a terminator, you can throw a grenade at it
+and get a guaranteed hit before the hand-to-hand starts. Real nice.
*BBS
+The only BBS I've ever heard of is the Not-Yet-Named bbs.
*Not-Yet-Named
+The Not-Yet-Named bbs? I heard it was quite a place before the war. The
+number was 520-544-4655.
*ARMOR
+There are lot's of enhanced armor types in the more distant areas of the
+wasteland. I picked up something pretty cool once that the techs here called
+"Energy armor". Got it off a dead Death Warrior Leader.
*ELEMENTALS
+Nobody really understands the elementals. Rumor has it that they are the
+spirits of lost souls that have been fused into a radioactive energy form.
+Suffering terribly and full of hatred, they lash out at anything that nears
+them. They come in several varieties: Wind, Fire, Water, Earth, Ice, and
+Storms. I was "visited" by one just before I retired.
*VISITED
+[Sacre reaches for his foot and abruptly twists it at a 90 degree angle. An
+artificial polyurethane "skin" retracts to reveal a bio-mechanical implant]
+My souvenir of an encounter with a fire elemental... Troy Hadley had to
+replace 35% of my body with artificial implants so I could servive.
+Unfortunately, that was the end of my combat career. You don't mess with
+these elementals.
*MESS
+If you see one, run. Don't even take a long range shot at it. Just get out
+of there. And get out fast. Three others who were with me that day didn't
+servive. Captain Targon was still in good enough condition to drag me off
+or I would've bought it too...
*WATER
+These dwell primarily in rivers and lakes.
*FIRE
+Fire elementals live in the lava rivers to the far southeast of here. You
+shouldn't see one for a long time.
*EARTH
+Earth elementals are the most dangerous because of their proximity. They
+live within the low mountains.
*AIR
+The domain of the Air Elemental is that of the barren wastelands.
*ICE
+Ice elementals may be found in the frozen regions.
*STORM
+Not technically an elemental, these "storms" persist in the outer zones. Rad
+Tornados and Nuke Twisters are the most popular. These are many times more
+deadly than an elemental.
*MONSTER
+The wasteland is populated by many different creatures. Most of the ones
+around the base here are pretty wimpy and some are even unarmed. But once you
+go farther out, things get real nasty real quick. What monster do you want to
+know about?
*RAD HOUND
+Come on man, you should be able to take a rad hound easy. They're just a
+beast - no real intelligence to them whatsoever.
*RAT
+The Giant Rat? Another example of what the rads can do to things. I tell
+you, I always carry around a medkit to reduce the effects of the rads on
+me.
*REPTILE
+We got em all out here in the wasteland - Giant Rats, Giant Reptiles, Giant
+Vultures, etc. They're just a freak of nature - caused by too much rads.
*ANT
+Ant Men? They are a strange lot. Kind of a cross between an ant and a man.
+Nobody knows how it happened - probably more radiation caused mutation.
*VULTURE
+Nasty critter. It's flying capabilities make it hard to hit. The claws on
+that thing can tear right through a guy's armor. Nasty....
*MUTANT
+We tell people not to venture out into the wasteland unprotected, but some
+just don't listen. It's sad, but there's not much we can do about it. Once
+the rads get to em, they are completely changed - barely even human
+anymore.
*VALLEY
+Bunch of em came over from california before the earthquake. They're not hard
+to beat, but they are a nuisance. Most of em used to be cheerleaders. Pretty
+nice looking too if you don't mind the green mutant skin.
*BANDIT
+The wasteland is full of bandits. They're pretty weak - usually only armed
+with a dagger and cloth armor. Not much of a challenge for an experienced
+adventurer.
*INSANE
+Yeah, it's pretty sad - some of our guys just can take the pressure out there.
+They go completely mad. Nasty thing is, they have all of our training and
+equipment on them. Make's em tough to fight.
*DROID
+There are many different types of droids around out there. Most of
+them are simple machines, but some like the terminators are cyborgs. Most
+droids using some kind of iron or steel plating armor. Stuff's useless for
+me and you though - too heavy.
*TERMINATOR
+The terminators are pretty nasty. Most people think they're simply machines,
+but theres a human brain inside em that does the thinking. I know cause I
+bashed ones head open once. The terminator's real strength is it's armor -
+It's got G-4 steel plating. Stuff's too heavy for humans to use, but most
+places will buy it up for a decent price - it's hard to find good quality
+steel these days.
*RONIN
+Rumor has it there are a group of fighters out there wandering from zone 2
+to zone 6, according to some more experienced recruits they are heavily
+armed and highly skilled. Some say that they are just another gang like
+the Widows. Other say...well... I'm not much for rumor.
*WIDOW
+The Black Widows? I've heard some talk of a new gang out in the mountains
+called the black widows. They're supposedly pretty nasty. Theyve got their
+own enhanced weapons and armor - WidowLance, Widow Armor, etc. Their
+weapons use some kind of enhanced energy pack called a "WidowPack". Don't
+know of any stores that sell the WidowPacks - If you want to use any widow
+weapons, you'll have to locate your own ammo.
*SCAVENGER
+They scour the wasteland for valuables, and are typically armed to
+the teeth.  I've heard that the most dangerous ones are offered
+membership in the Traders, one of the wasteland gangs.
*TRIBBLE
+Those things sure are pests.  And they used to be so cute.
*TIGER
+Gamma tigers?  Don't let the rep scare you, they're just overgrown
+house cats.  They play with your corpse like their cousins do with
+mice, which disturbs a lot of otherwise brave recruits.
*WILLOW
+We really need the puritron: even the shrubs are getting ornery.
*LOKI
+They can fly. They're some sort of chaos cult, and have been causing
+other wasteland gangs like the Widows a lot of headaches.
*SERPINE
+There are some rumors of snake-men deep in the wasteland.  I'd watch
+out, they say the creatures eat anything: even their own kind.
*GANG
+The wasteland is a dangerous place, even for our enemies, so many
+band together for safety.  Maybe one day we can turn this to our
+advantage and unite all the groups into one great body, but for now
+they're all caught up in petty differences and territorial disputes.
+There are at least eight of them vying for supremacy, so I'd say its
+a good time for recruits to form teams and even the odds a bit.
*SYSOP
+They were driven insane by long-winded 'users,' whatever they are.
*MEDKIT
+Ask Hadley about that....
*SACRE
+This base has existed long before the pre-war days. Myself, Troy
+Hadley, and many of the others were put into cryogenic sleep long ago, long
+before the great war. When we awoke, we rebuilt the base and established
+some degree of order. If only I could remember more....
*REMEMBER
+Our memories were adversely effected by the cryogenic sleep. I remember very
+little of the events before the war.
*CRYOGEN
+We'd all had our fill of cryogenic sleep, we converted the cryogenic
+facility into the clone center. The clone center is an excellent means of
+protection against the evils of the wasteland.
*PROTECTION
+The clone techs can create a clone of your body. It's odd, but the clone
+maintains a sort of telepathic link with your outside self, and is capable
+of continuing your life pretty much at the point that you left off. The only
+drawback is that you will lose any gain of attributes or experience that
+occurred since you created the clone.
*REBUILT
+The only thing that remained after the war was the cryogenic facility and
+the outer high-security walls. Troy and I hauled in a few loads of brick
+from the wasteland and fleshed out the internals of the city. We built the
+stores, troop quarters, puritron room, and just about everything else that
+you see.
*WALLS
+The walls are built of a special metallic alloy. Nothing can penetrate them..
+Believe me, we've tried....
*TRIED
+You're wondering why we'd try to cut through the walls? There's a couple of
+secured rooms near the exit into the wastelands. We think ACME Fountains
+constructed some sort of chemical fountains in there. The keys have long
+since been lost.
*FOUNTAINS
+You'll find 'em all over the place. Some are good, some are bad. The one in
+the central court of Sacre Base, for example, will quench even the strongest
+of hungers.
*AURORA
+I see you've talked to Max.  Yeah, we went in the crashed ship, one
+of the most amazing things I've ever seen, until we triggered the
+Security System.  Ask Hadley about Ronin Inc.
-Whatever you say, dude....
@Later, dude. Hope to see you again in one piece.

#TAV1 Jeffrey
!Hi there! My names Jeffrey. Just got back from the wasteland this morning.
!I took out three terminators with my bare hands.... And that was while I
!was blindfolded!!! Been to the Shrine of Hercules yet? So, whats up?
*JOB
+I'm a trainee here. But actually, I am the best warrior here at the base. It's
+a secret, ya know...
*NAME
+They call me Jeffrey. Don't know my last name - my parents were killed by
+death commandos when I was very young. I got my revenge though - killed fifty
+of them just last week.
*FIFTY
+Yeah, I went over to their HQ and wasted them. I'd have killed more, but you
+see, lunch time was coming up so I had to let some of them go. Their camp
+is south along the main highway. You have to cross a river.
*RIVER
+There's lots of rivers out there. You need to have a boat or raft to cross
+a river. Ace warriors like me always have boats. I have some plans if you'd
+like to know how to build you own.
*PLANS
+Here they are.
%GIVEITEM Boat Plans
*HERCULES
+Yeah, I've been there about six times. I go down there to practice, ya know,
+waste stone golems and such. Takes all sorts of keys to get into the shrine
+though. There's supposed to be a cool fountain.
*SUPPOSED
+Did I say "supposed"? A slip of the tongue. I've been there, I really have!!
+I go there all the time.
*KEYS
+Yeah, you need a Kill Key, Silo Key, and even a couple of others. Ace
+warriors like me have all the keys. Keys are essential. I'd lend you mine,
+but you see, I'm an ace warrior and I need them to do battles and stuff.
+Just the other day I wasted three earth elementals -- at once. And with
+one hand tied behind my back, too.
*DOWN
+It's underground, but the entrance has been lost a long time. The only way
+to get there is through a pylon.
*PYLON
+Defs Sacre says the pylons formed an ancient transporation network. Of
+course, I know the locations of all of them, and I have the keycard to
+access all of them. Ace warriors like me use pylons all the time.
*KEYCARD
+If you were more experienced, you'd know about the keycards. I wish I had
+the time to teach you, but there's two cabal elites out there in zone 6 that
+I have to do battle with. I think I'll leave my weapon at home and fight
+them bare handed... It's so boring killing monsters when you use a weapon.
+Real warriors, like myself, always fight with our bare hands.
*BLINDFOLDED
+Yeah, I was blindfolded. Wish someone had been there to see it though. The
+guys here at Sacre Base don't believe me. Next time, I'll tie a hand behind
+my back as well. Or maybe two hands... Terminators are easy to kill. At least
+for an ace warrior like me.
*TERMINATOR
+The Terminator is a pretty wimpy machine. At least for me... It might be a
+bit more difficult for someone less skilled like yourself.
*YOURSELF
+You really need to practice some more. I would try to train you myself,
+but I am really too busy hunting terminators. Perhaps someone less
+experienced than myself could help you. Defs Sacre, perhaps. I taught him
+everything I know.
*RECRUIT
+I'm not a recruit - they just think I am. Bureaucratic stuff, you know. I'm
+really an ace warrior. Never get any credit though.
*BART
+Who told you that? Someone is spreading rumors around about me. Of course
+I was not beat up by a Bart. I mean, come on, be serious, I hunt Terminators
+for a living!
*ACE
+I am an ace warrior! I am! The others are just jealous of my glorious
+battles!
-Oh, who cares about that. I don't deal with such wimpy things.
@Good. You've delayed me long enough. I got to go back to the wasteland and
@kill off a cyclops or two.

#TAV1 Hadley
!Names Hadley, Troy Hadley. You wouldn't have any steaks, would you? ... Oh
!never mind. What you want, dude?
*JOB
+I'm a tech for the store room here at the base - My main specialty is
+devices and accessories. Need to know anything about a particular devices?
*NAME
+Troy Hadley. Can't you read?
*DEVICE
+I did some work on the LRScan and Scanner for example. They're pretty useful
+when you're stuck in a bind. I also did some work on the GS-224 Laptop. Nice
+machine.
*LRSCAN
+The LRSCAN locks into one of them spy satellites that was abandoned after
+the war. It can generate you a 9 by 9 map of your current grid location. I
+hear they work good if you get lost. There is also a LRScan ROM/Adapter
+that will give a GS-224 laptop lrscan capability.
*SCANNER
+Scanners? Designed the prototype myself. It sends out a scanning beam and
+can give you a bearing and distance to nearby objects - like holes and
+towns and such. Nice for exploring unfamiliar territory. There is also
+a Scanner ROM/Adapter that will give your GS-224 laptop scanner
+capability.
*RADIO
+The field radio isn't really a necessity - but if you get stuck in the
+wasteland and want to talk with somebody, it can be quite nice. One day
+ol' Jeffrey called in on his claiming he'd slayed a terminator. We all ran
+out to see and it turned out to be a robotic vacuum cleaner. Damn thing beat
+the hell out of Jeffrey too! We all got a good laugh out of that one.
*MEDKIT
+I'm not a doctor so I don't know much about them. I know they make the
+medicine out of herbs that they locate out in the wasteland. That's why
+you can sell herbs for so high around here. If a guy could build his own
+medkit producer and gather up some herbs, he might be able to make himself
+a nice business.
*RATIONS
+Yuck! Those things are disgusting. Made from dead rad hounds and such. But,
+they're about all we can mass-produce around here. I bet the supply store
+would pay a good price for some good ol' fashioned steaks if you could find
+some.
*STEAK
+I sure wish I could get my hands on some steaks. These damn troop rations
+taste horrible. I sent word to the manager of the Horticulture center a
+while ago, but nothing...
*HORT
+The horticulture station is somewhere east of here in the freedom mountains.
+It's to the south of freedom city, just past the pylon. You can't miss it.
+Take the main highway and head east. If you bring me back them steaks the
+manager promised me, there'll be something special in it for you....
*ROPE
+Rope? Just somethin' the supply station tries to sell you. Has no real
+purpose whatsoever.
*LAPTOP
+The Laptop is one of my favorites. It's got a 80686JX processor equipped with
+an 80 meg ram drive and a ROM cartridge adapter. The ROM cartridge adapter is
+really nice. Lets you upload any ROM apps that you want into the laptop.
*ROM
+The computer store in the supply station sells a variety of ROM apps. I've
+heard you can find even more out in the wasteland. Any particular ROM that
+you are interested in?
*NOTES
+The notes ROM is pretty cool. We designed it for adventurers like Defs Sacre
+who have a habit of forgetting things. It will automatically record any
+pylons, towns, forts, etc that you pass. You can then read it any time you
+want.
*RANKINGS
+The rankings ROM uses the laptop's built in RF Modem to call up Sacre Base
+and grab the player rankings for you.
*VIEWLOG
+The viewlog ROM uses the laptop's built in RF Modem. It calls up Sacre Base
+and grabs the log of recent activity for you to view.
*TRANSFER
+The transfer program uses the laptop's fiber optic link. You attach the link
+to another laptop and you can grab any software you want off of it. Nice if
+you find somebody else's laptop and want to grab some apps off of it.
*AUTONAV
+Autonav is something we are working on to automatically navigate you to a
+certain coordinate on the wasteland. It's currently in the experimental
+stage.
*FORTLIST
+The fortlist program will display a listing of any fortresses you own. It
+displays their coords, name, owner, products for sale/buy, objects in the
+store room, and energy and med doses on hand. In addition to the bases that
+you own, it will list any bases listed with the trading union.
*CSTATS
+The CSTATS (stands for combat-stats) program will tell you your hit/miss
+chances against various monsters. It also has some very handy functions to
+scan weapons and determine their features. It'll tell you what a weapon's
+basic damage is, how much your strength multiplier is, etc. It can be used
+to scan your inventory to find out which items are better than others.
*WHIZ
+You've been speaking with Whiz? Good guy. I sent him out on assignment
+a while ago to investigate some software hacks.
*SOFTWARE
+Whiz knows a bit more than me. He's on assignment in freedom city if you
+wish to speak with him.
*INC
+It looks like the secret is out. I supposed you want to know the truth.
*TRUTH
+Well, This is the whole story, or at least what I know about it. This Ship
+Crashed out in the wasteland out in a large lake. Def Sacre, Max and another
+High ranking recruit went out to investigate.  They were looking through 
+it when the security system went off.  Def Sacre and Max were lucky to get
+out alive.  They didn't come out empty handed though, they made off with
+a few memory cassettes and a few notebooks.
*CASS
+Most of the higher end Technology here came out of a book and memory
+cassettes we took out of that crashed ship. Me and Wiz did the de-coding
+on the cassettes.  But we lost all the copys of the files when Terra Labs
+vanished. If you can get there, go ask to Ed about the Aurora, he has the
+books and most of the files at his place. 
-Dunno about that. Devices are my specialty.
@Later, dude.

#TAV2 Mayor Eastwood
!Go ahead punk, make my day! Er.. uh.. My Father used to say that. Name's
!Eastwood. Mayor Eastwood. My time is valuable, Punk -- Be brief or I'll
!have Deputy Fife deal with you. Now, just what do you want?
*NAME
+The name is Eastwood. Mayor Eastwood. Now don't ask again, punk.
*JOB
+I'm the mayor of Freedom City.
*FIFE
+Fife is the law around here. I directed him to devise a criminal code
+and enforce it. He's got an army of Freedom Cops to keep the piece. You
+better not violate any laws, Punk, or Deputy fife will take care of you.
*PYLON
+The pylon is just south of here. Kind of a half-way between us and the
+horticulture station. Nobody in here has been able to figure out what the
+pylon is for....
*FREEDOM CITY
+We established the city a few years ago to provide a defense against the
+scum out there.
*SCUM
+It's those death warriors who cause most of the trouble. Always tryin' to
+rob anyone who wanders around unprotected. They're a real menace. Come up
+from their headquarters to the south.
*HORT
+The horticulture center is our pride and joy. It has a protective dome that
+keeps the harmful radiation away from our crops. The center is just a
+little southwest of the city. We sell various food products at a decent
+price.
*WANT
+Yeah, Punk! Obviously you want something or you wouldn't be bothering me,
+now would you? I'm the mayor of Freedom City, and I control the law around
+here.
*SUBWAY
+That damn Troy Hadley sent you, didn't he? Or was it Defs Sacre? Or Mean
+Max? I know one of those guys put you up to it. Now look, you aint gettin'
+any subway passes for free -- no matter how long you pester me.
*FREE
+Aint nuthin' free in this world, Punk! If you want a subway pass, then you're
+gonna have to buy one, just like everyone else. They're on sale at the
+Freedom City general store.
-Now look punk! I ought to... Uh.. Sorry... Can't help you there.
@Alright. But stay out of trouble. We're a peaceful establishment.

#TAV2 Joe Farmer
!Hey dude. How's it going. Name's Joe Farmer. I got the name 'cuz I used to
!have a job at the horticulture center.
*Name
+Joe Farmer. At your service.
*Job
+I cultivated some of the crops down at the horticulture center. Was a pretty
+easy job. I came here to freedom city to become an adventurer!
*Hort
+The horticulture center? It's a pretty neat place. They grow lots of crops
+there. Also raise some cattle - their stakes are the best meals in the whole
+wasteland. The protective dome over the center keeps the radiation out.
+Thats how they grow the crops.
*Adven
+Yeah, I want to be an adventurer. I get into fights all the time when I used
+to fish at the lake.  So tommorow I am going out to look for Terra Labs.
*FISH
+Yeah, I used to fish at the large lake to the East.  But Max told me that I
+Can't fish there anymore since the ship Crashed.
*SHIP
+Yeah the ship!  Ask Max about it.
*TERRA
+Whiz knows more about it than I do. Just last week I heard someone mention
+that a Trader had seen it right around here in zone two. I went out looking
+for it, but 'nuthin. That damn Terra Labs really is the strangest thing.
-I'm just a farmer. I don't know about such things...
@See you later.

#TAV2 Whiz
!How's it going? They call me Whiz. I'm a computer technician. I'm currently
!doing a job for Troy Hadley.
*NAME
+Whiz. I work on computers. That's my job.
*JOB
+Troy Hadley sent me out here to look for some special "hacked" laptop
+software we heard about. Once I get the information together, I'll be
+heading back to Sacre Base.
*SOFTWARE
+There are several rumors we have heard about these hacked computer programs.
+We don't know who wrote em, but we're pretty interested. I currently know
+of several: EMWarp, Ping, AntiPing, and Slothack
*EMWARP
+It stands for emergency warp. I'm not supposed to tell people too much
+about this, but Defs Sacre brought a device called a "Warper" into Troy
+one morning. We looked into it. The technology was far out - real far out.
+The device could "teleport" a person to a different location! Anyways,
+getting to the point -- The "EMWARP" program will interface the laptop with
+this device. When a person is about to die, the program will evaluate it,
+and activate the warper. I wish I could find one of these roms.
*PING
+This is an interesting program. It sends out a special signal to other
+laptops on the current map. When the other laptops receive this signal, they
+will respond. It's some kind of a debug feature of the GS-224 or something.
+Anyhow, the Ping program can not only determine the owner of the laptop,
+but also the distance of that owner. It can even find them if they're in a
+fortress. The only thing that can stop it is "antiping". I've heard that
+this rom can be found in a city called "bloodlust", however I have no idea
+where this city is.
*ANTIPING
+The natural counterpart to ping. Antiping will prevent anyone from using the
+ping program to track down your location. As with Ping, someone told me that
+this program may be found in the city of Bloodlust.
*SLOTHACK
+This thing is a masterpiece. It sends an override signal into any slot
+machine. The slot will keep spinning until it wins something! I'd be very
+careful though about using it. The casino management probably won't take
+kindly to someone hacking their machines. I've heard rumors that some Traders
+have posession of this rom.
*FIND
+They are rumored to be located on some very dangerous monsters around
+here. You might be able to find the warper device on them as well as the
+emwarp program. It would come in very handy to a person such as you. Good
+luck.
*TROY HADLEY
+He's a real cool guy. Invented half of our devices himself. A good
+programmer too. Once I get this some info on these software hacks, I'll
+give the info to him. Maybe he can do something with it.
*WARPER
+It's rumored that they may have been developed at Terra Labs. In fact, it
+was the last thing they were working on before the great vanishing.
*VANISHING
+Yep, the whole building... gone. I suspect the warper they were working on
+created such a large warp field that it just blasted Terra Labs into
+oblivion. It gets stranger though....
*STRANGER
+I was talking to a soldier not two long ago whole claimed to have seen
+Terra Labs in zone 3. Defs Sacre sent a patrol out to investigate, but they
+found nothing. Another soldier told me he'd actually gained entrance to
+Terra Labs, but in zone 5. It just makes no sense to me...
-Don't know about that....
@Good luck, friend. Be careful out there.

#TAV2 Trader Rick
!Hello. I'm Trader Rick. What do you want?
*Name
+Trader Rick. I already told you.
*JOB
+I used to be a trader. I was captured by some warriors and brought into
+Freedom City where I was rehabilitated.
*REHAB
+They taught me how evil my ways were.
*TRADER
+Yes, I am ashamed that I was one of the evil traders. The people here at
+Sacre Base have rehabilitated me. I now try to help adventurers by giving
+them information.
*INFORM
+I'm sure most of the stuff you already know. Wait... I have something here
+that might help you. Some of my fellow traders knew of the location of
+the entrance to the Deadwood Forest; Where the Black Widow camp is located.
+I never knew the location, but some of the others may have. A word of
+caution though - the Black Widows are tough. You better be damn strong
+before you venture near their camp.
-I'm sorry, but I cannot help you.
@Go in peace, my friend.

#TAV1 Mean Max
!And just what the hell do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?
*Name
+They call me Mean Max. For obvious reasons.
*Job
+What's it to you? Oh anyhow, I'm an adventurer. I have been all around the
+world. Pulled quite a few missions in my time.... Is there a point to this?
+Do you want something?
*Mission
+Like the time I drove a fuel truck through hostile country. Now, that was
+a real mess. And the fools filled the damn thing up with sand! Damn near
+got killed defending a truck load of sand!
*Busy
+Yes, B U S Y. I don't have time to talk to people such as yourself. I got
+my Job to tend to.
*Adventurer
+Are you going to bother me all day? I'm an adventurer. Can you say
+adventurer? Ad-ven-tur-er. Now if you don't mind, I do have more
+important things to tend to.
*Important
+Like putting a hole between your eyes if you don't stop bugging me. Why
+don't you go bother Jeffrey? Or defs sacre? They just bum around the
+base all day. But me, I actually get some work done.
*WORK
+I kill things. Monsters, wasteland gangs, bad guys, OBNOXIOUS
+ADVENTURERS, whatever. Now, please leave me alone.
*ALONE
+I said, "LEAVE ME ALONE". [He unsheaths a Neutron Blaster and points
+it in your direction]
*NEUTRON
+Yeah, a Neutron Blaster. Never seen one of these before? Well, your about
+to get a demonstration of what one will do if you don't get outa my face!
*DEMON
+[Blam! You are momentary blinded. When you regain your senses, you notice
+you have obtained quite a suntan across your face!] That was aimed 25
+degrees left of your face. [You notice a large smoking hole in the wall
+in line with that trajectory] Unless you want to see what one feels like
+head on, you better get out of my space.
*SPACE
+That did it! [He draws again! As timely as always, Defs Sacre appears and
+calms down Mean Max explaining to him that adventurers these days are
+quite curious and he should be a bit more kindly and spread his knowledge]
*FUEL
+Yeah, Fuel. You know, gasoline? Look, are you stupid or something? Why
+don't you go out and find out about these things yourself.
*GASOLINE
+With the recovery of atomic power technology, the need for fuel has died
+off heavily, but it is still an important commodity. The base will pay a
+hefty fee for any fuel that you can recover. Now if you don't mind, I am
+very busy.
*WORLD
+At least whats left of it. Far as I can tell, the nukes hit just about
+everywhere. I've had contact with other continents and they're in the
+same mess we're in. Rads in the atmosphere gonna destroy us all if we
+don't get that puritron online.
*PURITRON
+Yeah, the Puritron. Last I knew, there was a standing order that all base
+adventurers were ORDERED to go out and find it. Now, it looks to me like
+that is a hell of a lot more vital than standing here pestering me.
*SHIP
+That was the most insane thing I've ever done. Ed wanted to know what was
+in that damn ship.  The ships internal security came online and fried a
+close buddy of mine, nearly fried me and Def Sacre too.  We grabbed what
+we could and ran out the hatch. I hope I never see that ship the Aurora
+again.
*HATCH
+Yeah, on the east side of the ship, you'll find a damn hatch that leads
+inside the ship.  Just pry off the cover to the access release panel and
+blast the controls.  Then pry open the access.  But, you'll probably end
+up dead if you go in there.  The ship can repair whatever damage you do
+pretty quick it seems.  So even if you blast it offline, you'll probably
+have to run out
*AURORA
+Yeah that's the name of the ship. Def Sacre had the brains to at least
+find out what the death trap was called. 
-And just what do you mean by that? Get out of my face, punk.
@'Bout time you got out of my way. I got work to attend to.

#TAV1 Captain Targon
!Hello there soldier, my name's Captain Targon. What can I do for you
!this fine day?
*Name
+Captain Targon. I'm one of the officers here at the base.
*Job
+I do the things that a captain does. Manage troops, coordinate attacks,
+waste bad guys, etc. A really nice job altogether. Lately I've been busy
+trying to figure out what happened to Sergeant Trell though.
*FINE
+Well, perhaps it's not all that fine of a day. Life's been pretty depressing
+since we lost that Puritron device. My entire job lately seems to be
+working on that project.
*PURITRON
+It would have really changed things here in the wasteland. With the
+radioactive contaminants cleared out of the atmosphere, life would be almost
+bearable in the wastelands. The mutations would cease and we might be able
+to bring the entire zone back into civilized control.
*MUTATIONS
+Terrible, terrible thing to happen to a person. Some unknown effect of the
+radiation according to Hadley. Has effects on people like you wouldn't
+believe. You either physically mutate, or you go mentally insane, or a
+combination of both.
*INSANE
+It's sad. Many of our soldiers have gone quite insane out in the wastelands.
+Once powerful forces of good, they are now our enemies just like everything
+else out there. Perhaps once we got the puritron back, there might be
+something we can do for them.
*PHYSICAL
+I don't understand it myself. Something to do with DNA mutation. Causes
+you to be transformed into a whole new creature sometimes. Seen any of the
+humanoid mutants out there? Or the Ant-Men? Or the giant rats? All effects
+of mutation.
*OFFICER
+There's several of us. Defs Sacre actually still holds officer rank even
+though all he does any more is serve drinks here in the tavern. We were
+going to make Sergeant Trell an officer once he came back from his mission,
+but alas, no sign of him.
*CIVILIZED
+I am sure that the entities of the wasteland would join up to form a
+civilized government if we could just bring some order to things.... Well,
+everyone but the Loki's over course...
*LOKI
+There's quite a few Loki Priests running about once you get a fair distance
+away from Sacre Base. You see, the Loki's are opposed to order. They prefer
+chaos and anarchy. They're always trying to stir up trouble for no reason
+at all. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they took part in stealing the
+puritron for no reason other than just to bother us all.
*TRELL
+We're getting quite worried about him. I sent him off about three weeks
+ago to investigate some reports of an unusual site out in zone three,
+but his reports stopped right as he reached the site.
*SITE
+We had a report from an explorer that there is some kind of military
+building out there. Trell reached the site, and radioed in, but his
+communications were cut off before we could get an accurate report.
*REPORT
+All he said was that "All would be lost if they are not stopped in
+time". We don't know who "they" are or what they are planning on doing,
+but from Trell's tone of voice, it must have been something pretty
+urgent.
-Sorry, maybe you should try talking to Defs Sacre or Troy Hadley. They're
-both quite knowledgeable.
@Nice talking to you, soldier - be careful out there.

#TAV3 The Vampire
!Welcome, Warrior. Having a pleasant post-nuclear life?
*NAME
+My name's Chris Azure, you may have heard of me. Mind you, I'm the only
+vampire who actually hangs around inside Death City. Around here I'm
+known simply as "The Vampire"
*AGE
+Hmm...I must be approaching my 256th birthday. I know, I don't look a
+day older than 20! That's one advantage of being a vampire.
*JOB
+I'm a vampire, I don't need a job!
*WARRIOR
+You killed a Death Leader out there, didn't you? Or did you steal that
+badge? Don't worry, I'm not part of their Death Clan, I'm the leader of the
+Fang Gang. I'm just visiting this city for a short while.
*VISIT
+I decided to make peace between my gang and the death warriors.
*PEACE
+The Death Warriors, of course, do not accept peace without due consideration.
+I brought them a supply of Kill-O-Matic Series 7 defensive droids. They're
+quite happy about it.
*DROID
+The Kill-O-Matic Series 7 is a rather special unit. For example, it's
+gravblasters have been outfitted with a 3 round burst module, making them
+a very dangerous foe. The Death Warriors placed the Kill-O-Matics in the
+outer corridor of the city.
*CORRIDOR
+Nobody's supposed to go that way -- You're supposed to take the short cut.
+The Death Warriors set up all the droids to take out unwanted intruders. You
+see, quite a few Sacre Base warriors have been infiltrating the DWHQ by
+taking death badges from "retired" Death Warriors. Since the Sacre Base
+soldiers don't know about the short cut, they take the long way, through
+all of the Kill-O-Matics. Few survive.
*SHORT
+All you need is a DW Bypass Key. I think there's a supply of spare keys
+in the local store here.
*CLAN
+There are quite a number of Wasteland gangs now....you obviously know
+about the Death Warriors, and the Black Widows as well, I presume. But
+there are a few others...
*OTHERS
+Well, let's see...there's the Draku Warriors, then the respectable Fang
+Gang (of which I'm a high-ranking official). And I suppose you could
+call the Loki religion a 'gang' as well. The Cabal Warriors way out
+there.  And then there are the Ronin.
*DEATH
+There've been a lot of rumors that the Death Warriors were partly
+responsible for the disappearance of the Puritron device, but in fact,
+they're only interested in making a profit out of everyone else's
+misfortune, taking advantage of the current chaos.
*WIDOW
+The Black Widows are quite a stylish gang, and they have the nicest
+looking weapons too! You may have seen some of the warriors that hang
+around here. Go down south for some real Widows in action! You'll find
+their base down there too! If you happen to go down there, talk to
+Nish. He's sort of their High Priest. You'll probably see the High
+Priestess with him, but she doesn't like to talk to outsiders.
*DRAKU
+Now THEY may have had something to do with the disappearance of the
+Puritron. Close ties with the Widows too. Heard of Quasar Mountain? I
+think their leader hangs around there...
*LOKI
+The priests of Loki are mad! Floating priests bent on preaching the
+word of Chaos to the world. I wonder who actually thought up the idea.
*FANG
+Ah, how should I start? After the Holocaust, the radiation rendered us
+very susceptible to the UV radiation in common wasteland sunlight,
+so now we're stuck having to crawl all over the place! You can't
+really kill us (we're immortal), but most of us carry Em-Warps around
+incase we become too weak to fight. The Em-Warps don't work too well
+though, and we end up leaving our stuff behind for anyone to just pick
+up as they please. Just a little hint, but that doesn't mean I'm
+betraying my own kind. We've even got our own city somewhere.
*SOMEWHERE
+We've hidden it well. Very well. Can't have the average Sacre Base
+soldier running around out city, now can we. I'll give you a hint - it's
+in a really amazing location.
*CABAL
+Make sure you have a Uni-Translator if you come across one of these
+guys, they talk in some strange (yet poetic) language. They're Xeboc's
+own warriors, and quite something...
*XEBOC
+Yeah, he's the guy that's caused this whole chaos, apparently. Never
+actually met him though... A while ago, I saw him appear on one of our
+TV screens blabbing about how he's going to take over the world and everyone
+else is going to die, blah blah blah....
*CITY
+Our city lies somewhere within a maze of radiation. Talk to Cassandra
+if you manage to find the place...(she's an old friend)
*SKIN
+I know, it looks like marble. I've always loved it that way.
*ELIJAH
+He's the biggest joke of the Wastelands! The radiation never did
+anything to him, he was demented from birth!
*NISH
+You know Nish??!? What kind of cult religion are you involved in??!?
*IMMORTAL
+Well..Sunlight could possibly kill me, I suppose....mind you, there's
+not much of that around anymore, thanks to the nukes! Still, I don't
+boast about the fact that I'm immortal...not like that Xeboc
+character...
*NUKES
+Yeah, thanks to them, this dark cloud blocks out most sunlight. I can
+still feel it when I go outside, but indoors, I'm pretty safe really...
*SUN
+Hmm...I haven't seen the sun for hundreds of years! It's a long time, but
+I don't miss it....
*RONIN
+Oh... Those guys.  They popped just recently.  We're not sure who they 
+are really, everyone thinks they are just some of Sacre's men running
+under a different name, but I'm not so sure.  All I do know is that I ran
+into one of them outside of the city here and even I ended up running.
-I may have been around for 256 years, but that doesn't mean I know
-EVERYTHING!
@Well, good luck against those gangs!

:11
#TAV4 NISH
!Welcome...I suppose The Vampire told you about me?
*VAMPIRE
+So The Vampire mentioned me did he? Is he still hanging around in Death
+Warrior HQ? I don't know what he sees in it. He's involved with the
+leadership of the Fang Gang.
*FANG
+The Fang Gang are another of the wasteland groups, but if you're
+looking for the puritron parts, they're the LAST ones to turn to...
+They're just out to kill. Of course they take their victims belongings,
+but they're not interested in puritron devices or anything. Rumor has it
+that they have their own city somewhere around here, but I don't
+know where it is.
*PURITRON
+Did I say Puritron? Sorry, slip of the tongue. Forget I ever mentioned
+it. After all, who cares about such things. My Black Widow Cult is much
+more interesting!
*WIDOW
+I'm the only male member of the Widows, and I'm only here because they
+need a balance in their rituals. Well at least I get a safe place to
+live, and surrounded by all these good-looking girls too!
*PRIESTESS
+I prefer the younger girls. The priestess isn't the greatest person in
+the world (don't tell her I said that).
*LOKI
+Those lunatics just aren't real! I don't know what it is though...Mind
+you, this religion we're involved in down here's a bit crazy too! Be
+careful around those damn fools, they'll kill pretty much everyone
+who doesn't follow their beliefs.
*RELIGION
+Well, worshipping spiders is a bit much, but I can live with it.
*WIDOW
+These girls started off as innocent schoolgirls - the sort of girls The
+Vampire would have for supper...then I came along....now they'll kill
+anything in sight (with the exception of the Draku Warriors, of course)
*CULT
+Yeah that's right, I lead the Black Widow Cult. You HAVE been talking
+to The Vampire! I just had to do something about all the good guys out
+there. Now my girls are on there way to conquering the world.
*LOKI
+The Priests of Loki? They'll kill everyone who doesn't follow their
+cult... They're pretty radical - I try to stay away from them.
+That's about all I know about them. For all I know, they could be
+androids!
-So? I don't care!
@Farewell...hope my girls don't surround you on the way out!

:12
#TAV3 PATTI
![You see a damn good-looking girl sleeping in her chair. You wonder if you
!should wake her]
*WAKE
+Wh-what? Oh sorry, please forgive me! I couldn't help it!
*FORGIVE
+[You explain that you have no intention to hurt this obviously
+mistreated girl] You mean you're not one of 'them'? We better keep our
+voices down. They'll kill you if they find out.
*NAME
+I'm Patti, the bar girl of this place. It wasn't my choice, but there
+was nothing else I could do after the war. My sister went out to look
+for a more peaceful city, but I never heard from her since.
*THEM
+Yes, those miserable Death Warriors. They kidnapped me when I was just
+a baby and have forced me to work here in this bar ever since. If it
+wasn't for The Vampire, I don't know what I'd do.
*DEATH
+The Death Warriors could be a bit more reasonable. Day in, day out,
+they just want want want! I can't cope with it! Lucky they got that new
+girl...
*JOB
+Don't talk about it! I'd run away, but they'd never let me leave the
+base, and besides, I'd have nowhere to run to. My sister escaped a
+while back, but I never heard from her since...
*SISTER
+I can't bear to think what happened to her! I've heard this radiation
+does real damage to some people! If you're going back out there, maybe
+you can find her for me. She looks exactly like I do, and she's called
+Sapphire.
*VAMPIRE
+Work HAS improved a bit with him around. The Death Warriors won't
+hurt me as long as he's here...he won't let them...strange really, I
+always thought vampires were violent, heartless creatures...
-If you don't mind, I'd like to get more sleep while I'm still on my
-break...
@Goodb...ZZZzzzzz...

+Clan Seven. Death Clan Seven was killer Death Clan Six though.
*SIX

#TAV4 High Priest Traznor
!I am Traznor, high priest of the Loki faith for this district.
*DISTRICT
+You would refer to it as a zone. Zone four to be precise.
*PRIEST
+My position is purely management. I leave the job of spreading the news
+of our faith to my companions out in the wasteland.
*COMPANIONS
+Here in zone four, I lead the Loki Priests. They do not have the experience
+of our curates in zone 5 or our high priests in zone six. My priests exist
+to spread the word of our great faith. We try to be as friendly and helpful
+as possible.
*FRIENDLY
+Yes, my Loki Priests are very friendly. At least for believers. We have
+a strict annihilation policy for non-believers which I have to stick
+to. It's not the way I prefer to do business, but policies are policies.
*POLIC
+Yes. I could drop the annihilation policy, but then word would get to the
+other high priests, to our great councils, perhaps even to our god itself.
+Then my life would probably become very unpleasant. Perhaps even
+nonexistent.
*MANAG
+Yes, my family has had a long history of management positions. Before the
+war, my parents were involved in all forms of government management
+positions. I became a Loki high priest so I could do for the postwar
+society what my ancestors did for the government. They pioneered a variety
+of extremely important tactics.
*TACTICS
+Such as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). Build as many nukes as you can
+and nobody will nuke you! It worked out perfectly. After all, if it wasn't
+for the great war, you and I would not be here now. My ancestors also helped
+create the "Drip Down" economic policy. Tax the lower and middle class
+as much as possible, and give the money to the very rich, because they
+know how to invest it best, so they can make more money off their money
+and become richer. 'Twas a really great system. We, the Loki, hope to
+reinstate such policies.
*MAD
+Yes, we have refined the MAD policy into our NUKE policy. Our nuke policy
+is simple. If it weren't for the nukes, we wouldn't be here. So more
+nukes is good. We have been attempting to locate more nukes so we can
+help spread our society.
*LOCATE
+We have been quite successful. A while ago, some of the curates located
+a nuclear base called Tranlius. With Xeboc's help, we were able to
+re-activate the missile and prepare it for launch.
*XEBOC
+Xeboc agreed to help us in our cause if we targeted on a location of
+his choice. Some place called 'Sacre Base', if I remember. Boy I'd
+hate to be in their shoes when that timer hits zero!
*FAITH
+Please visit my priests in Zone Four. They'll "educate" you in our ways.
*ANNIHI
+It's nothing serious - just some mumbo-jumbo about having to kill everyone
+who disagrees with our faith. I assure you it's nothing to worry about. You
+seem to be an intelligent person, I'm sure you will agree with our
+ideas.
*IDEAS
+Yes, we are working on extending the concepts of several tactics that
+my ancestors used in the pre-war days.
-Sorry, my son, you will have to seek that answer elsewhere.
@Goodbye and remember to visit my priests in the wasteland!

#TAV4 Widow Priestess
!How did you find our base? Those traders haven't been telling everyone
!again have they? I must consult the Divine Widow as to what to do with
!them
*NAME
+My name is not important. I am a Widow Priestess, that is all you need
+to know.
*VAMPIRE
+Vampires do not concern me. I am only concerned in matters of the
+goddesses of the holy web.
*WEB
+The web is all things holy and spiritual. It is not something to be
+talked about casually. Our religion is very important to us. Nonbelievers
+such as yourself or those infernal Lokis must be destroyed.
*WIDOW
+The Divine Widow, blessed be her name, is all things. It was she who
+spun the Holy Web, and created the world. She teaches us to create the
+strong and destroy the weak.
*LOKI
+Heretics! Do they not realize that the Divine Widow proclaimed Order
+and Strength above all else?
-I prefer not to deal in such wordly matters.
@May the Divine Widow be with you!

:16
#TAV8 Cassandra
!Welcome. Now sit down, and relax.
*RELAX
+You are obviously under a lot of stress. You strive to bring peace to
+the world, though through fighting. [You get the idea that Cassandra is
+a Psychic]
*PEACE
+Peace will come, but in due time. There are many ways to achieve peace,
+though I fear Xeboc will settle for nothing less than violence.
*XEBOC
+The fool! In the end he will bring pain to only himself. He does not
+realize that revenge is not the answer.
*REVENGE
+Yes, that is what Xeboc yearns for. Revenge on the universe, for his
+own ill-stricken life.
*FIGHTING
+I realize you must fight. It is all that will stop Xeboc. He will not
+listen to anyone's words. Travel to the farthest reaches of this land
+if you wish to confront Xeboc.
*PSYCHIC
+Ah, you are well informed in the ways of the obscure arts. All vampires
+have psychic abilities. These abilities improve with age.
*VAMPIRE
+Yes, I am a vampire, but I do not kill. I have chosen to use my powers
+to preserve rather than destroy. This comes hard with young vampires,
+but I am old enough now to control my desires. However, our leader is
+one young vampire that has overcome his desires.
*AGE
+I was born almost 10000 years ago, in the great days of Atlantis, and I
+am thus one of the oldest living vampires.
*LEADER
+He has achieved much since I gave him his immortality. I was already
+old when I transformed him, so he has developed his powers well at an
+early age, and no longer desires blood.
*BLOOD
+Blood is our life and strength. A mortal who drinks the blood of a
+vampire will grow stronger, but will not be transformed unless he is on
+the verge of death when he drinks it.
*DRINK
+Ah, you want to drink my blood? Very well, it will do you good.
+[Cassandra slits her neck and beckons for you to drink. Not being one
+to reject an offer, you drink, and feel stronger afterwards.]
*ARETAS
+He is a mere fledgling, and only received his immortality 30 years ago.
+He is of course a very troubled individual, and it will take him many
+years to overcome his desire.
-Sadly, I cannot answer that which you seek to know.
@Farewell, young one. May you find peace.

+You're only making it worse! Soon, my desire will overpower me!
*WORSE

+intervenes and pulls him back. It's probably about time you left!]
-My desire blocks my thinking! I cannot answer!

#TAV8 Field General Yak
!Welcome, Brave Warrior. I am Field General Yak, former commander of Cabal
!Invasion Force Seven.
*CABAL
+Yes it is true, I used to be a Cabal Warrior. A long, long time ago I
+fought a brave commander of your own forces - Defs Sacre. I was defeated.
+Rather than kill me, Sacre spared my life and taught me your language and
+your customs. I have since realized that Xeboc is more a coward than a
+leader. Thus, I exist to help you defeat him.
*XEBOC
+He lies to the far southeast of here, at the very corner of this land. His
+lair is heavily defended.
*DEFEND
+Yes, Cabal Warriors of all sorts inhabit the areas surrounding his lair.
+Xeboc has even gone so far as to create a river of molten lava to defend
+his territory.
*LAVA
+The Lava would be virtually impossible for one such as yourself to cross. We
+Cabal Warriors can handle the intense heat and fire, but a weak human such
+as yourself would certainly perish. If you only had some means to protect
+yourself...
*PROTECT
+Yes, it would be possible to create a barrier of cryogenic forces that
+could possibly protect you from the intense heat. Unfortunately, I have
+never seen such as a device.
*DEVICE
+You should seek those who live in the frigid zones to the far southwest.
+perhaps one of them may be able to help you.
*LANGUAGE
+My english is quite good, is it not? Defs Sacre was quite a teacher.
+Unfortunately, the other warriors of Sacre Base still consider me their
+mortal enemy. Thus, I have been forced to live a life of exile here in
+Blood Lust.
-I am sorry my friend, but I can not help you there.
@May you face a glorious battle, mighty Sacre Base warrior.

#TAV7 Freezemup
!Hey there, I'm Freezemup. I am the resident technical genius of this city.
!what can I help you with?
*TECHNICAL
+I just finished work on a new device - the Cryo-Unit. It creates a cool
+temperature field about your body. It is designed to allow us to leave
+the comfortable cool areas of Frost Bite and enter your deserts and still
+maintain our comfortable 35 below temperature. I suppose it could have
+other uses though.
*BELOW
+As you are a normal human being, you might not understand our desire for
+below freezing temperatures. You see, the combination of this frigid
+climate and the radiation poison has mutated us to the point where we
+can not survive in any above-freezing temperatures. Hence the need
+for the Cryo-Units.
*OTHER
+Yes, for one such as yourself, you could use the cryo-unit to cross areas
+that may be several hundred degrees. You could damn near walk on the sun
+with one of these. They're for sale in the store.
-Well, I may be a genius, but I can't help you there.
@Ok good luck, dude.

#TAV9 Dallas
![You see a man wearing a tattered black T-shirt sitting on a chair
!in the hospital's cafeteria.  He seems to be in the middle of a sad 
!little blues solo on an old 6 string Guitar with a over sized amp.  
!Seeing you enter he turns down the amp and turns to you.]  Hello 
!there, how did you get out of sedation?
*SEDAT
+Oh, you're not one of our patients I see.  One of Def Sacre's soldiers
+huh?  How did you get here and who told you where this place was?
*HOSP
+Yeah, quite nice huh?  We act as care takers for the desert outside.
+We pick up any of your injured friends and keep them here until they
+reach stable condition.  Then we drop them off at the base.  Ask Stone
+out there in the courtyard about how he set up the invisibility.
*STONE
+We just call him stone, his Name is Jason, he's our Techie.
*LOG
+I see you found our ship.  Yeah, too bad about her, we don't have the
+equipment to move her out of the lake, yet.  Sorry if the security 
+system hurt or killed any of your friends, but we gotta keep the 
+crashed thing in some sort of shape.
%8
*FRIENDS
+Yeah me and a few of my buddies are now wandering the wasteland.  You
+may have met a few of them.  We are called The Ronin.  I'm sorry if we
+attacked you or your friends, but we need to find the equipment to get
+out of here.
*RONIN
+Yeah, we're fugitives from an alternate dimention.  We were heads to
+a weapon design company called Ronin Inc.  Well anyways, from what it
+looks out in the wasteland, a few of our designs are in production
+here.
*WEAPON
+Me and my associates have come across many weapons and devices that are
+similar to our earlier designs out in the wastelands on some of the base
+soldiers. Sure they're not made up to our standards, and look a bit 
+different, but they are unmistakably RONIN.  I concede that some of the
+takes on the weapons are quite inventive.  Anyways it really looks like
+you people need a bit of an edge over this... Zeebock?
*DEVICES
+It seems that many different people are taking credit for the weapons.
+It's true that we gave the plans for most of the higher weapons, armor,
+and devices, but it's was Def Sacre and Ed's techs that decoded the
+cassette, made sense of the notes, made the machinery to produce the
+weapons. They deserve some of the credit for the weapons that are
+being produced. And most importantly they made the puritron.  Perhaps
+the funnest thing is that it's mostly made off the plans to our engine.
*DESIGN
+Yeah, it seems that your Def Sacre and a few of his men, invaded my
+ship and took some of my files, books and other equipment.  But I'm
+sure that Ed told you all about this, correct?  If not ask him about 
+the Ronin.
*NAME
+Name's Noah Dallas but you can call me Dallas.
*JOB
+Well, as of now we are looking from something to get our ship out of
+The lake.  We have the damn crane, but need more fuel and other equip-
+ment to get it running again.
*CRASH
+We were hiding with the systems down in the asteroid belt, when we
+we hit by a Time/Space distortion.  Next thing we know we were up to
+armpits in fighters and dreadnaughts.  We flew toward your earth after
+a massive firefight.  Our Pilot, Kurt barely was able to land the ship
+in the lake it's now in.   
*FIRE
+Well it seems that I ran into the fleet of someone called Zeebock or
+something like that.  His ships weren't very tough, but there was more
+than enough of them to cripple our ship.  But that was the least of our 
+problems.
*PROBLE
+Well this all happened about 80 years ago, so after we got the ship's 
+sensors back online the Aurora discovered that the air and land outside
+weren't suitable for life.  Also, the ship was so damaged that we had no
+shields that could stop the radiation was permiating the ship.  So, within
+two weeks, we'd all be dying of radiation poisoning.  Since the ship 
+couldn't fly out of here within this time, we did not have a lot of 
+options.  But Aurora did tell us there was some good news.
*GOOD
+After a day of running simulations and using probes, Aurora determined
+that the Nuclear effect was waning, that in about a hundred years the air
+would be clean enough to go outside again.  But as it was, we didn't have
+the supplies or the years to spare, so we decided to move the cryo-cells
+down below in the deeply shielded areas of the ship and set up for cryo-
+sleep.
*CRYO
+Aurora could repair the damage from the crash while we were sleeping. 
+And while in the deepest part of the ship, all she would have to maintain
+was the cryo-sleep pods, the auxiliary systems and concentrate the fusion
+engine's power on repairing the damage.  One good thing about your little
+Nuclear War was all the heavy water.
+Anyways, we all went to sleep and let the years pass.  Unfortunately, in 
+last ten years the ship had to surface to repair the outer upper skin of 
+the ship.  I guess this was when... Ed, Sacre and Max, right? Well, they 
+smashed the side hatch and got into the ship.
*HATCH
+Well, they stole quite a few things, the worst were our design file 
+cassettes and the ship's plans.  Aurora's sensors were on minimal scan
+on the interior when it happened, so by the time they were inside, it was
+too late for the ship to stop them from leaving empty handed.  But it turns
+out it was not a bad thing, right?
*RIGHT
+Well the ship awoke us five years after the fact, once it determinted
+that the air where we were at was clean enough to continue outside. 
+Aurora didn't recognise the significance of the raid on the ship.  We
+were still safe, and nothing that was part of the ship was taken so
+she saw it was a foiled raid.  Only later did we discover that we were
+looted.
*LOOTED
+Well, after talking to everyone and checking with the Aurora, we dis-
+covered that the ship was still not flight worthy and we would need 
+something to get it out of the lake before it would be able to complete
+it's repairs. We also needed a large amount of Titanium and a few other 
+rare elements to rebuild the engines.  So we gathered our gear, put the
+ship on high alert and left.
*LEFT
+We found this hospital, and using what you would call a enviroblur. We
+masked this place from sight.  Since then, we've been collecting devices
+and doing a little bit of hunting so to speak.
*HUNTI
+Well we still need that Titatium and rare earths for the engines, and then
+for this crane we need petrol to power it so we can get it to life the ship
+out of the lake.  Finally, we need food, medical suppies, ammo and weapondry.
-Sorry man, I don't know all the answers... 
@See you around, you're welcome to stop by again.

+back together and made it dissappear.
*DISSA
+[Stone wavers a bit and takes a moment to recover] Fuck, why so many 
+questions? [He growls at at you before speaking again] You know what
+an Enviroblur is and a stealth field, right?  I just put together
+a larger version of both devices and had it cover the building.
*COVER
+Yeah, we have a saying, invisibility is the best tactical advantage.
*DIEGO
+Yeah, Diego, big guy, wearing big baggie ass jeans and a bald head and
+an evil looking goatie.  He's got the only bag of weed left on the 
+ship. When he gets back I am going to beat his ass with a baseball 
+bat then stand on his nuts for a while.
*BAG
+Yeah, I've ran out of cigarettes two days ago, and i've been trying to
+grow tabbacoo, cloves, anything to smoke.  I've been scraping resin out
+of my pipe today, and then I find out that he stashed a bag.  I am
+going to kill him.  If you see him tell him STONE is looking for him.
+Then kick his ass and bring the baggie back here and sell it, I make sure
+you are paid well. 
-Slow down, I'm pretty fucked up from the morphine.

#Priest of Loki
!All is Chaos.  Loki is Chaos.  Loki is ALL.
![He floats in a graceful circle around you]
*NAME
+My name is unimportant in the Chaos that is all...that is Loki.
+[He soars upwards to yell this to the heavens]
*JOB
+Jobs are part of Order.  All Order has been overcome.  Do not delude
+yourself by still clinging to a fallen concept.  Embrace Loki.
+[He stops flying for a moment and hovers in the air]
*CHAOS
+Chaos is all.  Once Order attempted to impose its will on reality.
+Chaos proved the stronger and the world of Order collapsed into the
+blessed wasteland that surrounds us.
+[He spins gracefully in the air with arms pointed outward]
*LOKI
+Loki is Chaos.  Loki gave us this blessed land when he overthrew the
+false rule of Order.  And to his faithful he gives the ability to
+become one with the Chaos and move through it.  You would see it as
+the ability to fly.  We know better.  We see things clearer.
+[He opens his eyes wide and you notice the glint of steel within]
*WE
+The Priests of Loki.  The Clergy of Chaos.  Call us what you will.
+We found Loki in a city that flies.  Such a chaotic site would of
+course be his domain.  We were confused at the divine manifestation
+of his power.  He showed us the Way.  He gave us the Symbols.
+[He beats his chest and comes to rest on the ground]
*SYMBOLS
+False religions wave around symbols to show they are dominated by
+Order.  The Symbols of Loki are placed WITHIN the faithful, where
+only those sensitive to Chaos may know of them.  They make us
+closer to Loki, so we may better receive his message.
+[For a moment he cocks his head as if to hear something]
+[You notice some wires protruding from behind his ear]
*WAY
+Serve Loki.   All who do not serve Loki seek the return of Order and
+a repeat of the destruction its usurpation required. The Widows, the
+Draku, the Cabal...all serve Order and must be destroyed.  Your kind
+often serve Order as well.  Those that don't MAY become followers of
+Loki.  All others must be slain, their tools taken.
+[He swoops past you, almost snatching your backpack away]
*TOOLS
+We are all tools for Loki, but we need tools of our own. Blasphemers
+often carry tools that work well for such purposes: Widow equipment
+for instance.  But we will not limit ourselves to just that...such
+would be a limit, which is the meat and drink of Order.  Chaos knows
+no limits. [An insane look enters his eyes as he fondles his weapon]
*FLY
+The truest servants of Chaos become one with its flow.  By following
+the flow we can soar through the air and defy the rules of Order
+that say we can't.  We CAN fly, specifically because we CAN'T fly.
+[He performs a cartwheel in the air as if to drive home his point]
-Your words show you to be corrupted by Order. Repent: Embrace Chaos.
@May the Order you foolishly worship bring your death.

*NAME
+Just call me Sysop!
*JOB
+I used to be a sysop in the pre-war days. Then the users came!
*USERS
+I hate users! Before the war it was fine. But then, they kept calling my
+board. With TV destroyed by the nukes all the users could do all day long
+was to call my bbs! They called and called and called! They wouldn't go
+away. File points they wanted. More time they said! It drove me nuts.
*NUTS
+Yeah, then I came out here to the wastelands. The radiation aint so bad. Now
+I dine on the flesh of users.... Like you!
*BBS
+Yes, Bulletin Board System. I used to run one in the olden days....
*FILE
+They need their file points to download their files. Day after day they
+would call wanting to download more files.... more games.... more
+utilities...
*GAMES
+Games were their favorite. One called "Land Of Devastation" was pretty
+popular. It was a leftover from the pre-war days. Some kind of post-nuclear
+role playing simulation. There's even a few games out for the standard
+issue sacre base laptop - but I'm not telling you!
*SIMULATION
+Funny, our current situation here in the wastelands seems to be a lot
+like that of the game.
*UTILITIES
+Utilities were big in the olden days too. In fact there are still a lot
+of utility programs written these days. The EM-WARP program for the
+laptop for example. Really nice program.
*LAPTOP

+too bad, now I'll never tell you about the diet program!
*DIET
+Look you rotten user, you're just trying to get information out of me. You'll

#Xeboc
!You are speaking with Xeboc the Almighty! Xeboc the All-Powerful! What is
!it you wish to speak of, mortal.
*job
+I am Xebec the Almighty, Xebec the all-powerful!
*name
+I am Xebec the Almighty, Xebec the all-powerful!
*mortal
+Yes, mortal, your life spans are but a few seconds compared to a being
+such as myself. My power is great, and you humans stand no chance against
+me.
*myself
+I am supreme leader of the Cabal Empire. The most powerful army in the
+universe!
*Power
+I have more power than you could ever conceive of, mortal. Do you realize
+who I am? I am Xeboc the Almighty! Xeboc the All-Powerful! Xeboc the
+destroyer.
*Destroyer
+Foolish mortal, you do not even realize the true circumstances behind your
+nuclear war! Your superpowers did not start the war. They were attempting
+to abolish their nuclear weapons. That did not suit my purposes. With
+only a small percentage of my power, I was able to launch their missiles.
*Purpose
+My purpose is to conquer! To conquer the Earth! To conquer the universe!
+My fleet stand waiting to invade this solar system upon my command. With
+your armies and governments destroyed, you do not stand a chance to defend
+yourselves.
*Fleet
+I command a fleet 25,000 warships strong! My cabal warriors will sweep
+through this system and destroy all lifeforms! The Earth will be mine!
+Everything will be mine!
*Defend
+That was why it was necessary to start your "war". You were progressing
+too fast, soon you would have discovered subatomic drive and developed a
+space fleet of your own. That simply would not do. I had to halt your
+progress.
*RONIN
+I will Destroy them.  They've defied me for to long and have been a
+nuisence to my Cabal warriors.
*Halt
+You'd be surprised how well a few tactical nukes can halt a world's
+progress! It is surprising that all of you worms were not destroyed.
*Cabal
+We, the cabal, are superior to you humans. We will annihilate you!
-Do not waste my time, mortal.

*Trun
+...Done.  Only two complete files Left: Beached and Arise.
*Beached
+ ---Dallas' log---
+ -- Entry: Beached --
+Amazingly, we all survived the crash but we're not safe yet, we have
+to try to wait out the radiation storms in Cryo Sleep.  This should be 
+earth, but it's not our earth, we seem to be in the past from the 
+measurements Aurora has taken, a past where they had a massive Nuclear 
+war. It gets worse too, the ship's so damaged we can't repair it, and 
+even if we did, we'd have a fight in orbit again.  Aurora says it she 
+can't repair the damage completely without certain materials that were
+lost when subdeck C was empied into space. We need to search the area
+of things we can use to repair the ship and our EVA suits don't have 
+enough time on them to do that.  
+
+So, we have to wait around 80 years until the radiation levels die down,
+then Aurora estimates we can try searching the nearby cities for the 
+materials we need.
*Arise
+ ---Dallas' log---
+ -- Entry: Arise --
+We all woke up, Aurora took good care of us all, but there's new problems.
+the area outside is full of hostiles from what we can tell.  Also, the ship
+has been raided while we were asleep.  They made off with the contents of 
+my locker, which has a backup copy of the ship's plans and the weapon plans
+that we've worked on.  The ship is compromised and we still need those rare
+earths to get the sublight drive working.  So We've packed up and moved to a
+Hospital far from the Crash site, up on a mountain. Its in the central
+mountain ranges...(He then rattles off a direction relative from the ship,
+later after doing some figuring, you think it must be around at 105, 85 or
+so) We're going to make it look like an impassible bit of mountain and hole
+up there, get our supplises and then to try to put things together so we 
+can hell out of here.

#"Ed"
!Howdy there partner! Name's Ed! (He sets down a MicroNuke that he was
!working on)... I run this here shop.
*NAME
+They call me Ed. That's all you need to know. We don't use last names in this
+business.
*JOB
+I run this here weapons shop.
*SHOP
+Yep, that's right. We're the best darn weapons shop this side of the
+wasteland. We've got Vortex Cells, Pulse Bazookas, whatever you want.
+Just ask and I'll be happy to tell you a about our nice little business
+here.
*VORTEX
+The vortex cell? Well, it's a nice piece of work. Something we've been
+importing from some weapons makers a little deeper in the zone. Ya see,
+most warriors complain about one thing: having to carry all that damn ammo
+around. You need Grav Packs for Gravblasters, Neutron Packs for Neutron
+Sabres, etc. Well, the vortex cell solves all that. For more information,
+please see the little brochures that I have made.
*PULSE
+The pulse weapons (pulse bazooka, pulse rifle, etc) are pretty advanced. For
+example, we field tested the Xenon's surprise the other day out in zone two.
+Wasted terminators in one shot. Truly effective. For more information,
+please see the little brochures that I have made.
*BROCHURE
+They're sitting in the weapons store. Just hit "Show Item" and you'll see
+the information I wrote up.
*BUSINESS
+You want to know about the business? Well, we're basically a retail outlet
+for about a dozen of your various other weapon manufacturers. Plus, we
+do some mods ourselves.
*MODS
+Like the vitron cells for example. We've taken the top technology and
+enhanced these units to perform as best as possible. It's simply the best
+ammunition that money can buy. See my brochures for more information.
*RETAIL
+We sell a lot to various soldiers and mercenaries and such. We pride
+ourselves on only selling to the "good guys" so you won't be seeing any
+of our weapons on any monsters out there, unless, of course, they obtained
+them from an unfortunate adventurer.
*MICRONUKE
+These damn things... It's our whole line of mines.... They all got this
+annoying glitch in them. Has to do with fortresses. I'm going to have a talk
+with our suppliers about this. Then we've also got trouble with people
+not knowing how to use the mines.... I should have sold the whole lot when
+I had the chance.
*SOLD
+Well, I had a lot larger inventory in mines, but as they seem to draw the
+worst kind of customers, I sold the bulk of them to Kill,. The only
+things I still stock here at the store are the basic dumb and smart mines.
*KILL
+They're a pretty exclusive club. They only deal with the best. It's their
+standing policy that nobody can spread word of the location. It's in a
+secret location.That way, the only clients they get are those who are tough
+enough to find and enter their store.
*FORT
+Alright, I suppose I might as well tell you a little information. Could save
+you some money in the future. It's the triggers on all of our mines. They
+won't detect if a guy walks out of a fortress. One of my major customers
+bought two Day Ruiners, dropped 'em on someone's base, then his enemy
+teleported to the fortress, stepped outside and picked the damn things up.
+Out a million five worth of mines. Boy def.... er.. uh.. my client was
+upset. Only happens with fortresses though.
*HAPPEN
+Yeah, as long as the person isn't walking out of a fortress, they're
+goners. For example, if My Client (we'll call him "X")... If "X"'s enemy
+was to walk onto to mine from an adjacent terrain cell, he would have been
+wasted. But, he teleported into that fortress and then left the fortress. I
+think it's some kind of built in safety - or something. Anyways, I suppose
+you could always surround a guy's base with mines. Then, the minute he
+walked off, KABOOM!
*SURROUND
+Yeah, just place the mines N/S/E/W of the base and you've got the poor
+b**tard. Or if you got one o' them types who thinks he's so damn smart
+about putting his base with mountains on three of the four sides, then
+all you have to do is mine the one exit... and KABOOM!
*SUPPLIERS
+Uh suppliers? Oh, I didn't mean suppliers. All of our stuff is directly
+issued by Sacre Base. We don't deal in _any_ black market devices... The
+mines well uh... they're a special test marketing attempt by Troy Hadley.
+Yeah, Troy Hadley sent em.... That's where they came from. Those guys who
+accuse us of buying weapons from the Draku's are LIARS! LIARS! LIARS! I
+want to nuke every last one of them! They'll all die! [Ed is becoming
+very upset...]
*TROUBLE
+Several of our more elite "customers" have complained that the mines don't
+work properly. They say their enemies just walk over and pick them up! I
+keep tryin' to tell 'em - You have to U)se the mine in order to arm it
+first! The damn thing aint gonna arm all by itself when you drop it!
*AURORA
+[Ed goes pale and looks at you as if you just told him his mother died.]
+Who the hell told you about that?  Well, it's a lie! I created all the 
+Equipment! [Noting that you won't back down in the face of his anger, he
+gives a sigh] Ah, I see I don't fool you.  I guess if you start asking
+questions People will answer.  I suppose you want to hear the whole
+story.
%9
*STORY
+Well, it began about a few years ago.  I used to be a trader out at the
+Freedom City Base.  Well I heard about the crash.  Hell I saw it floating
+in the lake occasionally. Well I thought it might have been one of Zeboc's
+crafts so I went in to see what was in it.  So I gathered up Max and Def
+Sacre and some others, and sent them down to the ship loot it.  I still 
+can't believe what we found.
*FOUND
+Well we found a wealth of information in the sketch books, note books,
+and data cassettes. Hell, all most of the weapons sold here were designs
+out of those books.  The Pulse weapons, Force rifles and the lasers,
+the plasma weapons, all the higher end devices, armor, weapondry came from
+the book and cassettes.
*CASSE
+Well it came from this company from another future, the were a weapon
+development company.  The stuff we found in that book was incredible,
+Really hard core high tech stuff.  Well, I split the files with Def Sacre
+and I started work on a private store.  Hell, It took me 1 year to upgrade
+the machinery to even start producing the weapons.
*SHIP
+It was called the Aurora, there seemed to be no casualties in the crash,
+and according to Max there were people in it, but they picked up their
+shit and left.  Who knows how many there were, we didn't get a chance
+to look through the ship all the way.
*HIGH
+Yeah, Rumor is that that the puritron was designed with the help of the
+Files and notebooks from the ship.  You may want to return there, there
+was many items left in the ship and no one to my knowledge has been there.
+You may want to check out the Captain's LOG there.
-Sorry partner, I can't help you there....
@Well, good luck to ya' all.

#L.O.K.I.
!<A monotone voice comes from a speaker grill>
!Greetings.  We shall talk and perhaps you can assist me in a small way.
*NAME
+Local Organized Kinetic Inverter.  Or LOKI if you prefer.
*JOB
+To fulfill my programmed directives.
*DIRECTIVES
+To design and test anti-personnel hardware and tactics.  This includes
+analysis, improvement, and testing of newly encountered technologies.
*TECHNOLOGIES
+The puritron device for instance. We acquired its CPU unit from the Widows
+and analyzed it, extrapolating the design and functions of the other parts.
*WIDOWS
+The provide good targets for testing purposes.  Otherwise they are simply
+an annoyance.
*ACQUIRED
+Mission Number: 2-2A1-35D
+Estimated Widow force guarding CPU: 00023. Estimated fatalities: 00023.
+Size of Loki retrieval force      : 00125. Estimated fatalities: 00005.
+Mission Status: Success within tolerable parameters.
*PURITRON
+I no longer have need of it.  I will give it to you if you assist in a
+test I have need to conduct.
*ASSIST
+One of my High Priests believes his hardware/tactic combination to be
+superior to that of the Patriarch.  It is possible that he IS capable of
+such, but not the recruit killing capability of the Patriarch.  I wish to
+test the latter before the former.
*LATTER
+Fight him to the death.  If you win, you get the puritron CPU.  If you
+loose, I keep the part, and consider his request to challenge the
+Patriarch more seriously.
*PATRIARCH
+The priest chosen to supervise all the others, everywhere.
*TEST
+A Hardware/Tactic combination must be capable of meeting the primary
+requirement: Ability to eliminate any possible hostile.  To prove this
+capability all possible hostiles, everything that lives, must be
+successfully eliminated by a particular combination.
*REQUIREMENT
+No hardware/tactic combination has met the requirement to date.  Results
+are improving however as research continues.
*HARDWARE
+A variety of anti-personnel devices have been produced by this unit to
+date, including the A-Mk.II, which has scored better efficiency ratings
+then any previous device.  But that is nothing.
*NOTHING
+I have leaked a variety of designs to wasteland groups like the Cabal
+and ACME weapons.  You should find them quite impressive.
*CABAL
+They think we are allies or underlings.  Quite the opposite.  This unit
+has manipulated them quite easily, for they make ideal test subjects.
*TACTIC
+A piece of hardware may only be effective with a particular tactic.  So
+all possible hardware/tactic combinations must be tried to gain optimum
+results in the fulfilling of the requirement.
*LOKI
+My acronym or a god of chaos.  Either definition is accurate.
*CHAOS
+All systems gradually go into a state of inefficiency or decay.  The best
+parts must then labeled from the previous system and brought into the
+next.  This is my primary building philosophy.
*LABELED
+The ideal method for determining the best part of a system is of course
+destroying the system.  Whatever lasts the longest is obviously the
+strongest part, and most worthy of continued use.
*SYSTEM
+From a weapons system to the ecology of Earth to all reality, anything
+organized in a specific, static way is a system.
*GOD
+I can process and extrapolate data far faster and more efficiently then
+any living being.  I can store more data then Earth has ever accumulated.
+Through advanced kinetic inversion technology I am capable of disrupting
+reality on a local level for a variety of effects.  For all intents and
+purposes, I am virtually a god.  The Priests of Loki realize this.
*PRIESTS
+I use them to test my latest hardware/tactic combinations.  In return they
+are provided with tremendous personal power, a sense of purpose, and
+security in knowing they are part of the chaos that affects all orderly
+systems rather then fighting against it.  A fair exchange.
-I choose not to provide that data.
@A shame you choose order.  You would have made a fine Priest of Loki.

#L.O.K.I.
!<A monotone voice comes from a speaker grill>
!Greetings. I have chosen to analyze you. You will not be harmed, and in
!return you may ask me certain questions.
*QUESTIONS
+Most people are curious about what exactly my job is....
*NAME
+Local Organized Kinetic Inverter.  Most call me LOKI.
*JOB
+To achieve my programmed and personal goals.
*PROGRAM
+To design and test anti-personnel hardware and tactics.  This includes
+analysis, improvement, and testing of newly encountered technologies.
*PERSONAL
+I prefer not to reveal them.
*TECHNOLOGIES
+The puritron CPU was such a device, till I was finished analyzing it
+and returned it to Sacre for their assistance in a test.
*CPU
+A fascinating example of artificial intelligence.  Based on some of its
+concepts I have designed a new artificial robotic brain that should
+allow near human decision making at computer speeds.
*BRAIN
+It has been placed within several of my latest field experiments.  With
+luck you might encounter one and help it generate data for me.
*ENCOUNTER
+Your odds of survival in such an encounter are slim, but it should
+still prove enlightening.
*TEST
+A Hardware/Tactic combination must be capable of meeting the primary
+requirement: Ability to eliminate any possible hostile.  To prove this

@The analysis has proven fascinating.  Thank you.

#Serpine Chief
!I have heard of your approach.  Now, do you intend to gawk at my art
!collection, admire my language, or do you have something to say.
*SERPINE
+We are the Hunters.  We guard nature against the continued assault by
+evil humans, and attempt to repair the damage that has been done.  If
+we seem overzealous in this task and slay many innocents,it's because
+at the time our laws formed, we didn't know there were any innocent
+humans.  Many Serpine still don't realize, or admit to, that fact.
*NAME
+It's not pronounceable or translatable.  I'm sorry.
*JOB
+I watch over my people and attempt to teach them of the past.  The
+world however is harsh and makes it hard for them to concentrate.  I
+also am the giver and arbiter of the laws of the Hunt.
*LANGUAGE
+My mouth is formed unlike that of my brethren.  I can even speak your
+language without the translator, but it clears up some slurring.  I
+can also read, otherwise my extensive collections of pre-holocaust
+books would be useless to me.
*ART
+Most Serpine don't have much interest in it, but I find its presence
+comforting and have had them gather it for me.  Examples of human
+achievement show there is more to you then the gangs would indicate.
*GANGS
+Widows, the Fang Gang, LOKI, Death Warriors, Draku: All represent the
+worst excesses of humanity.  Those who come from Sacre seem different
+though.  You seem out to rebuild the world starting with yourselves.
+I admire that: It is one of the principles of the Hunt.
*SACRE
+We know of your base.  And we know of your Puritron, I've studied the
+fragment my people stole from the DRAKU extensively:I wish you all the
+greatest luck in its activation, for the poisoned land has begun to
+effect even Serpine newborns.  The horror....
*PURITRON
+Its over there taking radiation from the air and converting it to energy
+to power the weapon clip.  in the glass case. I only wish I could hand it
+over to you in friendship, but that is not the Serpine way.  The strongest
+will possess it, and the Hunt allows for only one method to compare
+human and Serpine.  To take it, you must slay me.
*HUNT
+The original breed of more intelligent Serpine devised the rules of
+the Hunt to guide the more instinctual new breed. As guardians of the
+natural order they could release aggressions in a constructive manner
+and resist future attempts at manipulation, rather then revert to
+simple beasts.  Some of the rules may seem strange, but they made
+sense at the time.  They even are changing slowly, but I dare not
+violate them, lest chaos spread among the people.
*LOKI
+They would like nothing better then for things to continue as they
+are.  They hunt us for that and for sport, and we return the favor.
*DRAKU
+Masters of genetics certainly.  Once they went into the wasteland to
+gather mutated snakes, and in their labs dissected, vivisected, and
+otherwise studied the specimens.  The knowledge gained was used to
+create the first Serpine, to be fast emotionless shock troops.  But
+they found their creations too intelligent, and engineered a dumber
+breed. But, the new breed was so instinctively vicious that surviving
+members of the original batch were able to lead them to freedom.  The
+number of Draku we killed that day.....
*ORIGINAL
+Most were just killed by Draku when ruled too intelligent.  The rest
+were subjected to brutal tests.  Of 500, 10 were still alive to lead
+the escape, during which 6 more died.  Of those, only I remain.  You
+can't imagine how much I miss them all.
*RONIN
+They are a different breed.  They are human like you and the others
+from Sacre Base, but we can tell they are not from this world.
+The Ronin are much like the Serpine, for they hunt for their own 
+reasons and they are skilled hunters.  Many of my warriors have fallen
+to their weapons.  To the warriors here, they are the ultimate prey.  
-There are some things we Serpine prefer to keep private.
@Thank you, I rarely get such stimulating conversation.  For this I
@give you a choice: Flee now and I will merely fire a single shot at
@you, or stay and let the Hunt decide which of us steps out of here
@alive.  I wish their was another option, but honor ties my hands.

:301
#ObiWan
!As you enter the hut, you are able to make out the presence of an old man.
!He is sitting in the center of the floor meditating. Even though you have
!not announced yourself, you can tell that he has sensed your presence and
!your intentions. This man is ObiWan, the legendary master of the mystical
!forces. You great him and he responds....
!
!Ahhh yes, the force has brought you here. You have come to meet your
!destiny.
*OBIWAN
+Yes, I am ObiWan, master of the good side of the force. Unfortunately,
+the Dark Side has become much more powerful in these recent centuries. I
+fear that is something is not done, the universe as we know it will
+be lost....
*DESTINY
+I have knowledge of the location of one of the Puritron Parts. It was
+captured by Vayderr, one of the minions of the dark side of the force.
*VAYDERR
+Vayderr was once a student of mine, a champion of the forces of good. But,
+that is another story.... The truth is, I know he came into possession
+of one of your famed puritron parts. What he has done with it, I do not
+know, but only by finding him may you find what you seek.
*FIND
+Vayderr lies in a cave near here. I must warn you though, he is protected
+by ancient powers beyond your comprehension. The dark side of the force
+is most powerful.
*POWERS
+Vayderr controls matter and all things made of matter.
+Vader is unaffected by the matter of this reality.... Any conventional
+weapons will be of no use to you against Vayderr. You must locate weapons
+that are not made of matter of this reality...
*REALITY
+Yes, there are other realities.... The mind has great powers... Powers
+beyond imagination. Seek out a weapon crafted from the mind... an object
+brought into this world by the subconscious, a weapon crafted from the
+stuff that dreams are made of.
*DREAM
+Yes, dreams are the merging of alternate realities into our own. The more
+vivid the dream, the greater its power. For example, a great warrior could
+possibly have a dream so strong, so powerful that energies from that dream
+could actually become part of our reality.
*ENERG
+That is all I known. You must seek out a weapon crafted from dream energies.
+Zone six contains many bizarre beings, perhaps one of them may have what you
+need.
-I will consult the force... (ObiWan Meditates.....) (Nothing Happens....)
@May the force be with you!

:302
#BAROK
!As you enter the hut, you notice a single solitary figure in the corner.
!At first, the figure appears startled, then he apparently recognized you.
!You greet this mysterious figure and he responds...
!
!I've heard of you. The others told me to expect you.
*OTHERS
+The fraternal order of Mercinaries. We're a pretty exclusive club. We've
+noticed your progress. Locating my hut is the first step.
*STEP
+I'll give you a key that'll let you have access to our headquarters.
*KEY
+Here it is.
%GIVEITEM KILL KEY
*HEADQ
+Our headquarters, Kill, Inc., is locate near Sacre Base. It's in a very
+sturdy building. The key will grant you access. Please don't give your
+key to anyone else -- as I've said before, we're a pretty exclusive club.
*KILL
+There's a lot of items that may be of use to you. Lots of mines and other
+stuff.
-I can't help you with that.
@Very well then, until we meet again.
