VGATEST: Utility for testing LOD's VGA support on your hardware
(c) Scott M. Baker, 1995

Description
-----------

LOD versions 4.20 and above include support for SVGA graphics, in the
modes 800x600x256 and 640x480x256. This program is designed specifically
to test the operation of the 800x600x256 mode.

VGATEST should be operated from within your LOD directory because it makes
use of several of LOD's files including FONT8x8.FNT, FONT8x12.FNT,
LODVGA.PAL, BMPSTD.RES, and BMPBIG.RES.

Command Line Parameters
-----------------------

  /NOACCEL  ... disable S3 accelerator checking & tests

  /DUMPVESA ... dump VESA data to VESA.TXT

  /NOVESA   ... skip VESA check and autodetect actual card

Benchmarks/tests
----------------

The tests in VGATEST's benchmark section are listed below in order of
occurrence:

[compatibility tests. These are automatic tests used by VGATEST to ensure
 that certain portions are working correctly. They are only executed once
 and probably occur too fast to be seen]

  - S3 test. If your video card has an S3 coprocessor, then VGATEST will
    tell the S3 to draw a horizonatal line at coordinates (0,0) and check
    to make sure the S3 did what it was supposed to. This test happens
    very quickly and you probably won't notice it.

  - Flipper test. The flipper test will draw approximately 10 rectangles
    along the left hand side of the screen. VGATEST will use this to
    determine if the page flipper is working properly. This test executes
    very fast and has only one iteration, so you probably won't even
    see it.

[multiple iteration tests. These tests are executed repeatedly for a total
 of 5 seconds per test. The number of iterations that occurred during the
 5 second interval is recorded and used as a benchmark]

  - Cleardevice test. The entire screen is repeatedly cleared to a random
    color.

  - Fillrect test. Random filled rectangles are drawn.

  - Horizontal line test. Horizontal lines are drawn in random colors.

  - Vertical line test. Vertical lines are drawn in random colors.

  - Terrain bitmap test. Small (51x31) terrain bitmaps are drawn randomly
    in the top of the screen.

  - Bigpic bitmap test. Large (181x121) bigpic bitmaps are drawn randomly
    in the top of the screen.

  - 8x8 font test. An 80x25 text window is defined in the middle of the
    screen and text is written and scrolled through it. The message
    should read:
      "Screen scrolling simulation. ****** TESTING ****** TESTING ******"

  - 8x12 font test. Same as the 8x8 test, but with a larger font.

  - 8x14 font test.


Warning Messages
----------------

 - "WARNING: S3 coprocessor test FAILED. Perhaps no S3 is present?"

    VGATEST detected an S3 coprocessor, however when VGATEST tried to use
    it, the coprocessor didn't work. Either VGATEST was wrong and you never
    had one to start with, or some incompatibility is present.

    You should probably use the /NOACCEL switch when using LOD and/or GTERM.


 - "WARNING: VESA flipper had to be forced to int mode!"

    VGATEST had to switch the VESA flipper to interrupt mode to get pages
    to flip. VBE supports two methods of switching pages: By use of a far
    call and by an interrupt instruction. The far call is more efficient,
    but not all VBE adapters work properly with it. Thus, using the interrupt
    mode flipper may be necessary for compatibility reasons.

    You will need to use the /FORCEINT switch when using LOD and/or GTERM.


 - "WARNING: VESA flipper had to be forced to dual mode!"

    VGATEST had to switch the VESA flipper to dual mode to get pages to
    flip. The VBE standard supports up to two "windows" into video memory.
    Some VBE adapters designate one window as read and one as write. In this
    case, both windows may need to be moved to perform the desired graphics
    operations.

    You will need to use the /FORCEDUAL switch when using LOD and/or GTERM.


VGATEST revision history
------------------------

5/16/1995

  - S3 coprocessor code added. Tested on Diamond Stealth 64 & Stealth ISA

  - OAK support added. Untested.

  - Support for dual window VBE adapters added. Dual window is selected if
    (WinAAttr and 7)!=7. (i.e. WinA is not supported, not readable, or
    not writable)

  - VGATest will detect page flipper failure.

  - If Page Flipper Failure occurs on a VBE system, then VGATest will
    attempt Dual and Int mode VBE flippers.

  - Removed a confusing and possibly erroneous function call.

  - Modified TSENG flippers to flip both windows.

  - Modified benchmarks to run for a specified amount of time (5 seconds)
    rather than a specified number of iterations.

  - Fixed support for VBE adapters which use 1024 bytes/line in 800x600
    mode (incl. Diamond Stealth ISA)

5/22/1995

  - Added error checking to exit gracefully if fonts or palette cannot be
    loaded

  - Tests 8x12 font and 8x14 font in addition to 8x8 font

  - Correct palette (LODVGA.PAL) file is now loaded

  - Documentation update

7/11/1995

  - Added /DUMPVESA switch to dump vesa information to VESA.TXT. We're
    still having problems with vesa page flipping on some systems. I'm
    hoping this will fix it.

7/12/1995

  - Added /NOVESA switch to skip VESA check and try to autodetect the
    actual card.

  - Added support for cirrus 54xx and cirrus 64xx.

  - "Autodetection success!" is no longer reported when autodetection
    fails! :)

  - Fixed problem with improper video mode (i.e. not 800x600) being
    selected.

7/16/1995

  - I was not taking the VESA Granularity into account when doing bank
    switches. This has been fixed, and hopefully support is fixed with
    cards that use a granularity not equal to 64.
