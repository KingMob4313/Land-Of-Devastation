</HEAD><BODY><H1>Gterm for Windows
</H1><P>By Scott M. Baker
<P><HR>
<P>Warning! This is an _EXTREME BETA_ version of Gterm for Windows. By "Extreme
Beta", I mean that it has been very poorly tested. It might not work right.
It might not work at all. It might crash windows. It might do just about
anything! 
<P>This version is missing several key features and is in need of significant
polishing. It has been released because several users wanted to take a look
at it. 
<P>The executable is a Windows 3.1 application, but I have been testing it
under Win95 without any difficulty.
<P><HR>
<H3>Requirements
</H3><P>       Windows: version 3.1 or Windows-95
<P>Video: 640x480 or greater, 256 color support recommended.
<P>Sound: Shareware MOD player required, I suggest MOD4WIN 
<P>           CPU: 386 or above, 486 or Pentium recommended
<P>         Modem: 2400 baud and up, 9600+ strongly recommended 
<P><HR>
<H3>Installation
</H3><P><I>Gterm for windows must be installed into the same directory as
Gterm for DOS. This means you will need the file GTERM511.ZIP (or later).</I>
<P>Just unzip the required files into the appropriate directory... If you
wish to set up a program group or something, then you'll need to do that
yourself.
<P><HR>
<H3>Documentation
</H3><P>You may wish to look to the DOS version documentation: GTERM.DOC
in the distribution archive GTERM511.ZIP. It is for the DOS version, so it
will be somewhat inconsistant with this Windows version, but may provide
some
insight if you have problems. 
<P><HR>
<H3>Running Gterm for Windows
</H3><P>There are two ways to load GTERM/Windows: 
<P>
<UL><LI>STANDALONE: "wingt.exe"
<P>     This will load up Gterm/Windows in standalone mode. The baud rate
will be set to the rate specified by "initial rate" in Setup:Modem. You can
then use the dialing directory to call out to the bbs. 
<P>
<LI>EXTERNAL PROTOCOL: "wingt.exe COM x BAUD yyyy" 
<P>      This will load up Gterm/Windows setting the com port to "x" and
the baud rate to "y". This is intended for use as an external protocol from
a comm program.... however, most (if not all) windows comm programs don't
support external protocols, so I suggest the previous method. 
</UL><P><HR>
<H3>Setting Up
</H3><P>     By default, Gterm/Win will assume you are using a 2400 baud
modem on COM1. If this isn't the case, then you'll have to change a few options.

<P>       COM PORT: 
<P>       Go into Setup:Modem and set "initial port" to the com port that
you wish to use most of the time. 
<P>       BAUD RATE: 
<P>       Go into Setup:Modem and set "intial baud" to the baud rate that
you wish to use most of the time, or the rate to lock at if you wish to use
a locked baud rate. 
<P>       AUTO-BAUD OPTION: 
<P>       The Auto-Baud rate option (three checkboxes in the lower left of
the Setup:Modem screen) are somewhat confusing. Let me explain what they
do: 
<P>           "Do not alter baud rate" 
<P>       When you dial out, the baud rate will be set to the rate specified
in the dialing directory. After you connect, your modem will send a string
like "CONNECT 19200" or something similar. This option _ignores_ that message
and leaves the baud rate at what it was previously set to. 
<P>           "Lock baud at initial rate" 
<P>       This will force the baud rate to what is specified in the "initial
rate" box. The modem will _always_ be locked at this rate, regardless of
any baud rates specified in the dialing directory or any messages the modem
sends. This option is useful for high-speed error-correcting modems. 
<P>           "Use connect string rate" 
<P>       This will set the baud rate to whatever the modem's connect string
says. For example, if the modem responds with "connect 2400", the baud rate
will be set to 2400 baud. 
<P>       FOR EXAMPLE: 
<P>       Assume you have set "initial baud = 38400" and you are dialing
"joe's place" which has a dialing directory set to 9600 baud. 
<P>                                  Do not alter    Lock baud     Use connect

<P> &gt;You hit "Dial".                     9600          38400         
9600 
<P> &gt; (modem dials)                   (no change)    (no change)    (no
change) 
<P> &gt;modem responds with              (no change)    (no change)     19200
    "CONNECT 19200" 
<P><HR>
<H3>Dialing the BBS
</H3><P>I have created a simple, yet functional dialing system. You may access
it via the "Dialing Directory" and/or "Manual Dial" options from the session
menu. 
<P>       The screen should be largely self-explanatory, so try to play around
with the options if you get stuck somewhere. 
<P>       DIALING: 
<P>       Select the desired number in the list box and click on the "dial"
button. 
<P>       NEW ENTRIES: 
<P>       Hit the NEW button; a new entry will be added to the end of the
dialing        directory. Then move to it and edit the data. 
<P>       EDITING: 
<P>       Just select the entry and move over to the edit box on the right.

<P><HR>
<H3>Mod Sound
</H3><P>You can coerce Gterm/Win into playing MOD music by using an external
mod player and adding the following to the command line: 
<P>       "/AUDIOMOD &lt;playername&gt;" 
<P>       For example, "/AUDIOMOD d:\winmod\m4win.exe" 
<P>       Include the full path name! I have only tested this with M4WIN,
other mod players may or (more likely) may not work.
