AUTHOR Frederick Bell and Eric Meloche
;
;The next section, which consists of SETDESC descriptions, is a small
;introduction to this data set. You may wish to describe your scenario
;here, outline the types of areas in your world, etc.
;
SETDESC         What follows is a description of all that is currently known
SETDESC of the wastelands surrounding Sacre Base. The total habitable
SETDESC area of the wasteland is about 125 square sectors. Terrain beyond
SETDESC the wasteland is believed to be completely unsuitable for life and
SETDESC travel is not possible. Therefore, we suggest you confine your
SETDESC wanderings to the 125x125 square area. Land beyond these dimensions
SETDESC will appear as impassable mountains to your terrain scanner.
SETDESC
SETDESC         Sacre base is a human establishment, fully staffed by
SETDESC non-mutated, highly trained military personnel. All resources of
SETDESC Sacre Base are at your disposal, although most inventory in our
SETDESC stores requires monetary reimbursement for your usage.
SETDESC
SETDESC         Other civilizations exist beyond the confines of Sacre
SETDESC Base itself. Little information is available about these other
SETDESC civilizations and we suggest that you use caution when encountering
SETDESC new places.
SETDESC
SETDESC         The wasteland is populated by numerous extremely hostile
SETDESC creatures of unknown intelligence and motives. Attempts to control
SETDESC these hostile elements have been somewhat successful around Sacre
SETDESC Base, but as the distance from Sacre Base increases, more dangerous
SETDESC beings may be encountered.
SETDESC
SETDESC         More information is available from Defs Sacre and Troy
SETDESC Hadley, who may be located in the Tavern.

&BWalking forward, you have the most unsettling feeling of walking through
a field of energy. The invisible field breaks over you like a wave from the
sea, setting your hair on end and a hiss from the metal on your person before
you are finally through it. Now the building that you could only detect thr-
ough your scanner is revealed to you, the remains of a west wing of a hospital.
Walking up, you find a steel reinforced door, no guardian and no watchman of
any type.

&EInside you find yourself in a long cooridor, the pale lights marching along
the ceiling here.  To your left and right you hear the hum of medical devices,
and you can see that there are a few Sacre Base soldiers under care of the 
machines.  You try to rouse one, but she doesn't wake, and without an underst-
anding of the devices, you dare not tamper with them.  Stepping back out into
the hallway, you can hear the call of a guitar from far ahead and the right?
