LOD: "Lite" version [Graphics & Sound disabled]
(c) Scott M Baker

The "lite" version of LOD has the sound and graphics support hardcoded
out of the executable. By directly removing this support, approximately
30k of memory is saved. This is useful for sysops who have very limited
memory available when users shell to operate the door program.

The lite and normal (GAME.EXE) versions can coexist together. For example,
a sysop could use GAME.EXE to play in graphics mode locally while using
GAMELITE.EXE for remote operation for his/her users.

To use:

  - Just call the GAMELITE.EXE executable whenever you would normally have
    called GAME.EXE.
