Land Of Devastation Standard DataSet
Game Objective and Background

The War
-------
      It happened in the early 21st century. Nobody is sure actually when
as most recorded history was lost at that point. Nobody is sure who started
it, or what the reasons were, but one thing is for sure, the world was made
very aware of the possibilities of nuclear warfare.
      The estimated time is somewhere between 2051-2075 that the war
occurred. Hundreds, if not thousands, of nuclear missiles stormed through
the atmosphere. Their targets: Population centers, military outposts, and
governmental facilities.
      The effects were greater than had been previously theorized. Great
blast waves levelled entire cities. All unprotected crops and livestock
perished. Those who didn't die of the initial attack were killed off by
starvation or nuclear contamination.

Sacre Base
----------
      There was, however, at least one establishment that survived. A small
nuclear fallout shelter about 50 miles out from Tucson, Arizona. At the
first sighting of the nuclear clouds, the doors were sealed and the base
relied on its self-supporting supplies.  Also those in the base placed them-
selves in cryogenic sleep to wait out the radiation clouds that were sweep-
ing the globe.
      So after nearly a hundred years, those inside the base were reawakened.
While the radiation levels were now safe, there would be occasional radiation
storms that would catch the base unawares, so those inside Sacre base continued
their wait. After about five years, when internal supplies became scarce, it was
necessary to explore the outside world. The first explorations were lead
by Commander Defs Sacre, a survivalist who helped to found the shelter
before the war.
      Sacre was able to locate supplies necessary to sustain life in the
shelter for many years to come. Sacre also located a pre-war weapons
laboratory, Terra Labs. At Terra Labs, Sacre and his men were (With the help of
a local trader) able to develop advanced energy weapons - lasers, Tachyon 
Swords, etc.
      With these weapons, Defs Sacre upgraded the small, fragile nuclear
shelter into a full-fledged military outpost. In honor of his bravery, the
base was named "Sacre Base".

Nuclear Contamination
---------------------
      As a result of the great war, vast amounts of nuclear radiation were
released into the atmosphere. This radiation, in turn, affected the
environment in ways never before imagined. Peaceful animals were mutated
into hideous beasts; Humans were transformed into a disorganized mass of
criminals. Law and order completely collapsed. It was thought that all
hope of saving the earth would be lost.

The PuriTron Device
-------------------
      In the year 107AB, scientists at Terra Labs developed a device 
known as the PuriTron. This device would be capable of removing the 
radioactive contaminants from several thousand cubic feet of air per day.
      At last, it seemed that there was finally a solution to the world's
problems. The PuriTron would clean the radiation out of the atmosphere. The
radioactive mutations then would cease, and organized government could
be established. Sacre base was very anxious to see the puritron put into
action and ordered its transportation immediately.
      An armed caravan left Terra Labs later that year to transport the
PuriTron to Sacre Base where it could be installed and operated. The
situation was perfect. Too Perfect. About half way through the journey, the
caravan was attacked by a fierce band of female warriors known as the
Black Widows.
      The party was overwhelmed by the attack. The Black Widows had enhanced
weapons far superior to that of the caravan, since all of Sacre base's weapon
production still was not complete yet. The battle was devastating and only a
handful of men were able to escape. The PuriTron device, however, was lost.
      From intelligence gathering operations, it has been determined that the
Black Widows split the PuriTron into at least five separate components which
they then hide in separate locations throughout the wasteland.

The Quest
---------
      Your quest, as a soldier stationed at Sacre Base, is to locate these
lost parts of the PuriTron and return them to Sacre Base where they may
be assembled and activated. The fate of the world is in your hands.

PuriTron Device Parts
---------------------
      The following parts are required for the assembly and operation of the
  PuriTron device. Sacre Base will pay generously for their return.

      RAD EXTRACT

          The Radiation extractor is a device capable of collecting radiation
          from contaminated materials. The radiation is then collected and
          concentrated into the storage vessel. Non-radiated air is sent
          to the recycler for recycling.

      STORAGE VESSEL

          The storage vessel is a special lead cylinder capable of storing
          the concentrated radiation in a safe, leak proof environment.

      FILTRON

          The Filtron is a energy-enhanced filtration unit that removes large
          particles such as soot, sand, etc from the air. These debris are
          then sent to the RAD EXTRACT for decontamination. Clean air is
          sent to the VENT for return to the atmosphere.

      CIRCULATOR

          A large atmospheric collector. It collects air from the atmosphere
          and sends it to the FILTRON for processing.

      NOVA CELL

          A power cell containing stored solar energy. This energy is used to
          power the above equipment.

      VENT

          A high efficiency output device designed to return clean air back
          to the environment without creating any disturbance.

      RECYCLER

          Takes all particulate debris (dirt, soot, plastics, etc) and
          converts it to a plastic-like material which may be used for
          construction, manufacturing, etc.

      The following diagram illustrates how the above units operate together:

Locating The PuriTron Parts
---------------------------
      Locating the lost PuriTron parts will not be easy; We have absolutely
  no data as to the parts' location. You may have to rely on sources your meet
  out in the wasteland to reveal the necessary information.
