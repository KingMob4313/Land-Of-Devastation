Gterm for Windows 

By Scott M. Baker 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning! This is an _EXTREME BETA_ version of Gterm for Windows. By "Extreme 
Beta", I mean that it has been very poorly tested. It might not work right. It 
might not work at all. It might crash windows. It might do just about anything! 

This version is missing several key features and is in need of significant 
polishing. It has been released because several users wanted to take a look at 
it. 

The executable is a Windows 3.1 application, but I have been testing it under 
Win95 without any difficulty. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements 

Windows: version 3.1 or Windows-95 

Video: 640x480 or greater, 256 color support recommended. 

Sound: Shareware MOD player required, I suggest MOD4WIN 

CPU: 386 or above, 486 or Pentium recommended 

Modem: 2400 baud and up, 9600+ strongly recommended 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation 

Gterm for windows must be installed into the same directory as Gterm for DOS. 
This means you will need the file GTERM511.ZIP (or later).

Just unzip the required files into the appropriate directory... If you wish to 
set up a program group or something, then you'll need to do that yourself. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation 

You may wish to look to the DOS version documentation: GTERM.DOC in the 
distribution archive GTERM511.ZIP. It is for the DOS version, so it will be 
somewhat inconsistant with this Windows version, but may provide some insight 
if you have problems.

Running Gterm for Windows 

There are two ways to load GTERM/Windows: 

    * STANDALONE: "wingt.exe" 

      This will load up Gterm/Windows in standalone mode. The baud rate will be 
      set to the rate specified by "initial rate" in Setup:Modem. You can then 
      use the dialing directory to call out to the bbs. 

    * EXTERNAL PROTOCOL: "wingt.exe COM x BAUD yyyy" 

      This will load up Gterm/Windows setting the com port to "x" and the baud 
      rate to "y". This is intended for use as an external protocol from a comm 
      program.... however, most (if not all) windows comm programs don't 
      support external protocols, so I suggest the previous method. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting Up 

By default, Gterm/Win will assume you are using a 2400 baud modem on COM1. If 
this isn't the case, then you'll have to change a few options. 

COM PORT: 

Go into Setup:Modem and set "initial port" to the com port that you wish to use 
most of the time. 

BAUD RATE: 

Go into Setup:Modem and set "intial baud" to the baud rate that you wish to use 
most of the time, or the rate to lock at if you wish to use a locked baud rate. 

AUTO-BAUD OPTION: 

The Auto-Baud rate option (three checkboxes in the lower left of the 
Setup:Modem screen) are somewhat confusing. Let me explain what they do: 

"Do not alter baud rate" 

When you dial out, the baud rate will be set to the rate specified in the 
dialing directory. After you connect, your modem will send a string like 
"CONNECT 19200" or something similar. This option _ignores_ that message and 
leaves the baud rate at what it was previously set to. 

"Lock baud at initial rate" 

This will force the baud rate to what is specified in the "initial rate" box. 
The modem will _always_ be locked at this rate, regardless of any baud rates 
specified in the dialing directory or any messages the modem sends. This option 
is useful for high-speed error-correcting modems. 

"Use connect string rate" 

This will set the baud rate to whatever the modem's connect string says. For 
example, if the modem responds with "connect 2400", the baud rate will be set 
to 2400 baud. 

FOR EXAMPLE: 

Assume you have set "initial baud = 38400" and you are dialing "joe's place" 
which has a dialing directory set to 9600 baud. 

Do not alter Lock baud Use connect 

>You hit "Dial". 9600 38400 9600 

> (modem dials) (no change) (no change) (no change) 

>modem responds with (no change) (no change) 19200 "CONNECT 19200" 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dialing the BBS 

I have created a simple, yet functional dialing system. You may access it via 
the "Dialing Directory" and/or "Manual Dial" options from the session menu. 

The screen should be largely self-explanatory, so try to play around with the 
options if you get stuck somewhere. 

DIALING: 

Select the desired number in the list box and click on the "dial" button. 

NEW ENTRIES: 

Hit the NEW button; a new entry will be added to the end of the dialing 
directory. Then move to it and edit the data. 

EDITING: 

Just select the entry and move over to the edit box on the right. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mod Sound 

You can coerce Gterm/Win into playing MOD music by using an external mod player 
and adding the following to the command line: 

"/AUDIOMOD <playername>" 

For example, "/AUDIOMOD d:\winmod\m4win.exe" 

Include the full path name! I have only tested this with M4WIN, other mod 
players may or (more likely) may not work.
