;Combat string definitions
;
;NOTE: Changes to this file will not take effect until you have used
;      COMPILE.EXE to compile this file into monster.def.
;
;This file contains all of the combat strings used in LOD. (These strings
;used to be in the MONSTER.DEF file but were moved here)
;
;The strings are separated into several "groups" which define what actions
;the strings apply to. A new group is designated by the word "NEWGROUP".
;Then you must use the "INCLUDE" parameter to specify what actions will
;be included. The format for include is as follows:
;
;INCLUDE WH 1 0
;        :: : :-- Defender code
;        :: :
;        :: :---- Attacker Code
;        ::
;        ::------ Action Code
;
;The Action code can be any of the following:
;

;        WH - Short range weapon hit
;        WM - Short range weapon miss
;        WA - Short range weapon hit armor
;        WS - Short range weapon hit shield
;        RH - Ranged weapon hit
;        RR - Ready Ranged weapon
;        R3 - Ready Ranged weapon - 3 round burst
;        RA - Ranged weapon hit armor        (added in version 3.50)
;        RM - Ranged weapon missed           (added in version 3.50)
;        ST - Person is stunned
;
; (note: HH, HS, HM, and HA have been removed. WH, WS, WM, and WA will be
;        used instead when an attacker has no weapon - the weapon name will
;        be set to "fist" or whatever the FISTNAME of the monster is)
;
;The two attacked/defender codes are as follows:
;
; 0 - Applies to all attacks; Monsters, other players, etc. except for player.
; 1 - The user
; 2 - Another player
; 3 - Animal monsters - Rats, Vultures, etc
; 4 - Humanoid monsters - Death warrior, Bart, etc
;
; 5-99 are sysop-definable. You may use them for whatever you want.
;
; 100+ are reserved.
;
;For example, "INCLUDE WM 1 0" means that the strings are for Weapon Miss and
;for when a player (code 1) hits anything (code 0).
;
;"INCLUDE RH 1 3" would be for Ranged Hit (RH), when the player (code 1) hits
;an animal (code 3)
;
; %1 attacker name
; %3 attacker weapon
; %5 attacker range weapon
; %7 attacker he/she/it
; %9 attacker his/her/its
; %A attacker auxweapon
;
; %2 defender name
