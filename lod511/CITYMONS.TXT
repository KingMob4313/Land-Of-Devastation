NAME Stone Golem

DESC An ancient voice booms, "He who dares infiltrate the Shrine of Hercules
DESC must die!" Oddly enough, you could swear the voice was coming form a

NAME Grim Reaper

DESC A cold chill passes through your bones as a high-pitched chittering
DESC echoes down the passage. You abruptly turn at the sound of fluttering
DESC robes, only to see images of your own horrible death reflected in the
DESC glowing green eyes of a creature out of nightmare. Averting your eyes
DESC from the very image of death, you note that the chittering comes not
DESC from it, but from the air all around it.

NAME Super Gamma Tiger

DESC An eerie meowing makes you abruptly assume the defensive. As an

DESC much larger. This must be what is referred to as a "Super Gamma Tiger".
DESC It seems intent upon having you for dinner!

;================= FREEDOM MAP =============================================

NAME Bum

DESC "Can you spare some cash?" Peering out of the alley is one of Freedom
DESC City's many less-then-savory citizens. Either born in the drug-ridden
DESC slums hidden behind the glamorous store fronts of the main drag, or
DESC having settled after bringing in the the eye of a cyclops; many such
DESC individuals lack either the cunning to get around the cities draconian
DESC rules or the dedication required of a Sacre recruit. Instead they live
DESC off those generous or scared enough to give them money for food ...
DESC or less pleasant needs.

NAME Freedom Cop

DESC "Hey! You're in violation of city regulations. Charge #1: No loitering
DESC in the city limits. Charge #2: Walking without a license. Charge #3:
DESC Dressing in a military manner within the city limits. Charge #4: ...",
DESC The Freedom Cop continues for a seemingly endless amount of time
DESC enumerating the various laws you have broken. When he finally completes,
DESC he says, "All together, that is 814 violations of the freedom city
DESC uniform criminal code. You have been sentanced to 314 years imprisonment,
DESC 28 consecutive life sentences, and 1 sentence of manditory capitol
DESC punishment. Capitol Punishment will proceed immediately."

FRIENDITEM FCUCC Book

FRIENDTXT You reach into your pack and show the FCUCC book to the Freedom
FRIENDTXT Cop. The first law reads, "Deputy Fife is hereby declared the chief
FRIENDTXT law enforcement officer and shall therefore be exempt from all
FRIENDTXT laws." You explain that since you're carrying the FCUCC book, and
FRIENDTXT Deputy Fife is the only one allowed to carry the FCUCC book, then
FRIENDTXT you must be Deputy Fife. The Freedom Cop, not being very bright,
FRIENDTXT agrees and allows you to depart without further harassment.

KILLHIM The Freedom Cops last breath echos across the room, "... and one
KILLHIM count of murder of a police officer..."

NAME Pit Boss

DESC haven't found anything illegal. You can go if you want...", groans
DESC the Pit Boss as he realizes that he has no legitimate reason to detain
DESC you further.
