DESC ability to jump extraordinary distances, the craving for blood.  Damn
DESC the wasteland and its power to corrupt.  The mutant fur ball turns to
DESC attack you.

KILLHIM battle.  This can only mean that some of your fellow soldiers
KILLHIM must be selling equipment and weapons to the foes. Unthinkable.
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME Turncoat Soldier

DESC Rounding the bend you come face to face with a fellow soldier. A gut
DESC feeling tells you not to let your guard down.  Sure enough, he aims
DESC the barrel of his pulse rifle at you. This must be one of the scum
DESC that have been sneaking high powered weapons to the opposition.
DESC He smirks at your hateful glare, "I'm sorry, but they were willing
DESC to pay me more for one weapon then I could have ever earned as a
DESC honest soldier.  And you wouldn't believe the amount I'll get for
DESC your corpse."

KILLHIM A wave of satisfaction passes over you as you watch the turncoat

KILLHIM the large amount of cash on him, you know that he is most likely
KILLHIM not the only soldier to sell out.

NAME Cabal Warrior

DESC You hear an odd sound coming from around some bushes and decide to
DESC investigate. You notice a green scaley body hunched over working on
DESC some communications gear. From what you know of the wasteland, this
DESC alien being can only be one thing... One of Xeboc's cabal warriors.
DESC Genetically engineered and selectively breeded to be the perfect
DESC warrior, they are a most dangerous foe.

NAME Curate of Loki

DESC A blur of dark red passes before your eyes.  Nearly giving yourself
DESC whiplash in the process you follow it.  Standing on a ridge you see a man
DESC dressed in red and black with an extremely haughty expression.  "Woe unto
DESC you oh blasphemer," says the man, "Woe unto you for you have rejected Chaos
DESC to long.  You have been chosen as an example of how Order falls before the
DESC holy might of the Clergy of Loki.  You have been chosen just as he who once
DESC bore these weapons."  He indicates the neutron sabre at his side.  Then
DESC with a flourish he produces a Pulse Bazooka!!  Suddenly he lifts into the
DESC air with grace no bird could ever compare to and takes aim.

NAME Baby Jenks

DESC You see a girl approaching, who looks like she must be in her early
DESC teens. You wonder what she's doing all the way out in Zone 5. Then
DESC you catch a glimpse of the Fang Gang logo on her t-shirt. This must
DESC be the girl that The Vampire in Death Warrior HQ was mentioning.
DESC Unfortunately for you, she doesn't seem as friendly as The Vampire

NAME Shifter

DESC You always thought that the rumors of a fellow soldier who had been
DESC mutated by combined exposure to the effects of warpers, phase armor, and
DESC high intensity radiation were just that, rumors.  But as you watched the
DESC person materialize on the bluff ahead, then teleport to a succession of
DESC nearby spots, all without touching the warper at his belt, you realize

DESC fire sabre stabs at you from behind.  You turn to see him reform some
DESC sixty feet away, aiming something large at you.

NAME Chaos Knight

DESC "Thou art a thorn in the side of Chaos.  Prepare thyself to be plucked

DESC brings a massive integrated cannon to bear.

NAME Nick's Nightmare

DESC There's a legend which says there was once a mighty warrior named Nick who

DESC beast of his dream came to life and destroyed him. Until now, you've

DESC with such a supernatural beast standing before you, you begin to wonder
DESC if the legends actually had any merit.

DESC a deal with the evil Draku Warriors to create a beast sent to destroy
DESC Paladin. The beast succeeded. But, the beast was so fierce, so powerful,
DESC that it turned on Xenon himself and destroyed him. Such is the story

DESC a humanoid figure that hurtles through the air towards you with a sound
DESC that makes your ear ache.  Screeching to a halt in the air above you is a
DESC being dressed in red and black.  As he aims his tachyon blaster at you and

NAME Xanth

DESC During the initial landing of the Cabal, a large portion of their

DESC Cabal, who take pride in their hunting beasts, brought the few
DESC remaining to the Drakus.  Knowing the excellent skill of the Drakus,
DESC the Cabal insisted that the Drakus enhance the creatures previous
DESC abilities.  This is how the Xanth evolved.  That is also why they are
DESC now walking on four legs and using the other two for weapons.

NAME Cabal Commander

DESC approach towards you is well thought out.  Quick eyes scan the terrain

DESC of the best training, the best armor, and the best weapons of the
