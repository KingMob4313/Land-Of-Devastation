 Here's some tips to help you.

1: Buy good armor.
     The earlier you start with good armor, the better off you'll be.  In the
begining weapons are nice, but as the game progresses, there will be weapons
lying out in the wasteland.  It's not uncommon to find a 9mm or a .357 lying
in the sand, but armor is a little harder to come by.

2: Talk to people in the taverns.
     Remember, this is a RPG game, in the troop quarters there is a tavern,
there you will find people that will tell you a variety of things.  A good
place to start is by asking their NAME or JOB. this will lead you into other
threads (new things to talk about will be in red). Most importantly, if you
follow certain threads you can complete some quests getting experience, and
more importantly information that can lead you onto finding some interesting
stuff.

3: Join a team.
     Joining a team is the best thing you can do.  It gives you a 10% discount
in stores, and you can leave stuff for each other...`nuff said.

4: Buy Stealth fields.
     With stealth fields you can forge out into dangerous zones and not have to
fight.  Just use the item and set it on Quiet (or Noisy if you are feeling
"saucy").  This way you can sneak out and grab some automatic weapons or energy
weapons out in the deeper zones. (this is only true if someone has been killing
things out in the deeper zones)

5: Buy a clone.
     A clone lets you restart without losing stats for dying...`nuff said.
