       Results of the FIRST LOD Art Contest:

       Grand Winner:      Christopher Darque (For submitting an absolute
                          ton of images, this guy definately deserves
                          a place at the top of the list!)

       First Place:       "Xanth" by Doug Merha
       Second Place:      "Ant Man" by Tristan Walling
       Third Place:       "Humanoid Mutant" by Dave Rosson
       Honorable Mention: "Liarei" by Rick Armstrong
                          "Terminator" by Doug Merha

       Now that this contest is over, I suppose we'll have to see how
many more submissions arrive. If enough pile up, I suppose I'll be forced
to declare another contest and announce some more winners!

       If you are a good artist, then you are welcome to send me in
a submission of your work. The top pictures received will be used in
future releases of LOD! It's a great opportunity for you to have
your work immortalized in a doorgame!

       Specifically, this is what we need: The pictures are the ones
that appear in the upper left hand window of GAMEEGA/GTERM. i.e. they
are the guy using his laptop, the "hulk" attacking, the giant
rat, etc. the specifications of these pictures are as follows:

       - 180 x 120 pixels
       - 16 colors using standard IBM ega Palette (very important to
         use the standard palette)
       - We're mainly looking for pictures of monsters (i.e. the
         humaniod mutant, giant lizard, terminator, etc)

       If you would like to enter, then you may either send your art
on disk to my address listed below, upload it to my bbs listed below,
or find another way of getting it to me.

       Like I said, the best submissions will get published in the
next version of LOD. I will also put up a "listing" somewhere
(probably in the documentation or troop quarters menus) listing all
of the winners, what art they drew, etc.

       Please send submissions to:
