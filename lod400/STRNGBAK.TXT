&Bother skill.|~
~
~
~
&9|Alpha Combat|~
&9------------||~
&BIn alpha combat, your chances of hitting the hostile monster are base on how|~
&Bfast you can hit a specific key on the keyboard. In effect, this method tests|~
&Byour typing skills. If your stats are low and you are a good typist, you may|~
&Bwish to give this method a shot.|~
~
~
&9|Reflex Combat|~
&9-------------||~
&BIn reflex based combat, your chances of hitting the monster are based on your|~
&Breflexes. A number sequence will be presented and when you see a pre-determined|~
&Bnumber, hit your enter key. If you hit it fast enough, then you will hit the|~

&BYou approach the pylon. A massive door prevents your entry. Next to the door is|~

&BYou approach the pylon and insert your pylon key. The massive iron door opens|~
&Bto provide access to the pylon's interior. The interior of the pylon is like|~
&Bnothing you have ever seen. Huge electrical devices are lit up with a dazzling|~

&E|As you press the final button, a massive energy burst teleports you to another|~

&EAs you prepare to leave and tell the adventurers back at Sacre Base of your|~
&Emassive victory, you notice some motion in the back of the room. You turn|~

&Esays: "Foolish Mortal! Do you not realize who I am? Do you think I could be|~

&7with you. I'm the current manager of Hotels-R-Us, you know, the people who|~
&7offer the facilities that you have been staying in at these cities. It seems|~
&7that you owe us some rental money for staying in our establishment. If you|~
&7please see my office in the Troop Quarters investment section, we would be|~
&7grateful. By the way... this is really just a formality.... But the rules|~
&7say that I must inform you... We have a one-logon limit on payments. If you|~
&7have not paid us by your next logon, we may have to take some drastic|~
&7measures."|~
~
~
&7A man greats you at the front gates... "Sir, I'm a bit embarrassed to have to|~
&7address this matter at this time, but we have a slight problem. It seems that|~
&7you owe us a substantial amount of money... To gain access to the city,|~
