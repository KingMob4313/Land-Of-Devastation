NAME RAD TORNADO

DESC You have been noticing for sometime that the wind has been picking up.
DESC Now, as you look up, the sky is taking on an ominous color.  A memory
DESC tugs at your mind but you cannot seem to recall it.  Then it clicks, it
DESC was one of the original briefings back at the Base. Something about how
DESC radiation can interact with the natural environment.  Suddenly you
DESC remember, and a chill runs down your spine. A RAD TORNADO!  You were
DESC told that the best course of action is to escape and you are now glad
DESC that you sat through those long, dull lectures.  Looking at this
DESC powerful monstrosity you know that your weapons will be unable to
DESC tame it.

FLEERAN Huffing and puffing you manage to escape the deadly Storm.  The
FLEERAN weird howling of the wind will haunt you for a long time and the
FLEERAN image of that towering mass of destruction will not soon fade
FLEERAN from your mind.

FLEETXT You are not sure how, but you manage to get away.  You brush the
FLEETXT glowing dust from your body in a panic.  You can only hope that the
FLEETXT Decon procedures back at the base will handle the radiation that
FLEETXT covered you from head to toe.  'Next time', you think to yourself,
FLEETXT 'I am going to hotfoot it away as soon as I see one of those.'

KILLHIM The Storm shifts in it's course.  Your weapons have managed to break
KILLHIM up the forces that nearly destroyed you.  This is a feat that will
KILLHIM long be remembered.  It also shows the fine line between heroic
KILLHIM actions and really stupid ones.  Since you survived you will be
KILLHIM hailed as a hero, a few more moments and you would be just another
KILLHIM dead fool.

NAME NUKE TWISTER

DESC Your first warning is a sudden gathering of clouds.  And then a strange
DESC gust of wind carries the smell of ozone.  Rapidly the sky darkens and
DESC the wind increases.  The ground around you begins to glow with an odd
DESC light.  Then it begins to form.  Now you know what this is, a NUKE
DESC TWISTER!  One of the most deadly forms of 'natural force' created by the
DESC radiation in the wilderness.  A Nuke Twister is formed when a dust storm
DESC picks up radioactive waste.  In some fashion the power in the waste
DESC magnifies the storm into what you see before you.  You have been told
DESC that there is no way to 'fight' such a storm.  Your only hope is to
DESC EVADE!  You must run before the radioactive winds eat the flesh off of
DESC your bones.

FLEERAN You look over your shoulder as you evade the Twister.  You cannot
FLEERAN believe the violence:  It is literally ripping everything in it's
FLEERAN path down to bare rock.  You decide to put just a little more
FLEERAN distance between yourself and it before you rest.

FLEETXT Blinded and bleeding you manage to escape the Twister.  You know that
FLEETXT you are lucky, a few more minutes and you would have been dead. Next
FLEETXT time you will run at the first sight of this Storm.

KILLHIM Your continuous pouring of energy into the Storm has overloaded it! In
KILLHIM a huge explosion the Twister blows itself out!  You are amazed that
KILLHIM you have managed to do this.  Sometimes the power of man is something
KILLHIM that astounds even a cynical person like yourself.  You will get a
KILLHIM lot of mileage out of this story back at base, that is if anyone
KILLHIM believes you.

NAME EARTH ELEMENTAL

DESC An eery silence descends upon the rugged mountain pass. No, not entirely
DESC silent: There is a distant rumble, almost imperceptible. It draws closer
DESC and becomes louder till the very ground buckles with the strain, forced
DESC meters into the air.  And then all is still once more, save for the
DESC humanoid of pure rock that faces you, formed by the corruptive power of
DESC the radiation on the earth itself.

FLEERAN Running like the wind you manage to escape from the relatively
FLEERAN slow elemental. Soon you feel safe again, though the occasional
FLEERAN distant tremors make you rather uneasy.

FLEETXT The relative slowness of the being lets you get away, but you
FLEETXT soon discover numerous glowing rock fragments clinging to your
FLEETXT clothes and armor.  The Decon team back at base will have their
FLEETXT work cut out for them this time.

KILLHIM You are nearly buried as the cohesive force of the being fails and
KILLHIM pebbles and stone go flying everywhere. What else has this blasted
KILLHIM wasteland turned into a killing force?

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME FIRE ELEMENTAL

DESC The miraculous Cryo-Gen Device may let you pass over the lava, but it
DESC does nothing to ease your mind.  A great deal of heat still passes
DESC through, and the place reminds you of ancient tales of hell.  Of course
DESC if it was hell, you'd have to fear demons, but there aren't.....Wait!
DESC What's that?  Rising from the infernal terrain is a vaguely humanoid
DESC mass of pure flame.  It stretches out a burning appendage and lets out
DESC a crackling scream not unlike the sound of a hundred bon-fires.

FLEERAN The radiation's amazing ability to create new life has outdone
FLEERAN itself this time.  You turn and charge into the flames, hoping
FLEERAN to loose yourself in the writhing mass.  And it seems to succeed.
FLEERAN At least, none of the fire here is fighting back.  Yet.

FLEETXT By a miracle you avoid the flaming fiend the radiation has formed
FLEETXT from the fires around you.  But the ill feeling in your stomach
FLEETXT tells you the effect lingers on.  The Decon procedures back at base
FLEETXT better be ready to negate some serious radiation or you won't live
FLEETXT to flee from the next one of these you meet.

KILLHIM The fire elemental bursts into a veritable fire storm, only to be
KILLHIM absorbed into the burning lava from which radiation gave it life.

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME WATER ELEMENTAL

DESC Without warning the water here has gotten choppy and violent, shaking
DESC your raft violently.  But how could this be when just moments ago the
DESC weather was so calm?  Then it all becomes clear, as a hulking form
DESC bursts from the waves, a form composed entirely of water.  You don't
DESC need a geiger counter to tell you that the radiation has managed to
DESC bring life to yet another aberration.

FLEERAN Paddling your raft as fast as you can and using what little wind
FLEERAN there is to speed your way you somehow slip by your elemental foe
FLEERAN downstream and apparently out of its hunting ground.  You shiver
FLEERAN at what that virtual tidal wave could have done to you.

FLEETXT Somehow slipping out of its watery clutches you paddle away from
FLEETXT the creature.  But it may have its revenge yet, as you got rather
FLEETXT heavily soaked by the radioactive waters that spawned it.  You
FLEETXT swear that if the Decon team manages to fix you up, you will never
FLEETXT be foolish enough to attack one of these again.

KILLHIM The elemental rears up out of the water to a spectacular height,
KILLHIM then collapses into it with a splash.  After the ripples pass there
KILLHIM is no sign it ever existed.

NAME ICE ELEMENTAL

DESC You are starting to get really sick of the endless mounds of white and
DESC the bitter cold.  Anything to break the monotony would be of utmost joy
DESC to you, and you almost smile when you hear a sound reminiscent of ice
DESC being crushed behind you.  But your smile vanishes and your jaw drops
DESC when you see the massive crystalline structure approaching. It is shaped
DESC somewhat like a gigantic ape chiseled out of ice, but unfortunately is
DESC no sculpture.  It attacks with the ferocity that only a radiation spawned
DESC life form can achieve.

FLEERAN You plow headlong into a snow drift in your haste to escape, and
FLEERAN hide for long freezing minutes under the snow.  Eventually you
FLEERAN peer out and see that the creature has gone.

FLEETXT Somehow extracting yourself from the combat you charge down the
FLEETXT snowy path as fast as your chilled limbs will carry you.  For some
FLEETXT reason the radiation born ice creature does not give chase.  You
FLEETXT breath a sigh of relief as you attempt to determine how much
FLEETXT radiation you soaked up from the thing.

KILLHIM Huge slivers of ice tear at your skin as the ice elemental falls
KILLHIM into the snow and shatters.  Maybe monotony isn't so bad after all.

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME AIR ELEMENTAL

DESC A weird whistling sound echoes across the wastelands, accompanied by
DESC a sudden rush of air.  You whirl to see a cloud-like billowy mass
DESC floating over the broken terrain.  Though it seems to have no substance
DESC you get the unmistakable impression that it is hunting.  Could this be
DESC one of the dreaded elementals you have heard about?  They say radiation
DESC is a strange force... It can change healthy humanoids into diseased
DESC mutants. It can change a friendly recruit into a crazed insane
DESC soldier. If the forces are just right, radiation can even change an
DESC elemental substance into a demonic beast.  But the time to ponder
DESC ends abruptly as it blows towards you.

FLEERAN You turn and flee, the radioactive cloud pursuing at a lazy but
FLEERAN steady pace.  Your lungs feel ready to burst and your legs begin
FLEERAN to give out, but onwards you push.  But then, just when all hope
FLEERAN seems lost, a strong gust of wind blows through the area and the
FLEERAN elemental goes with it. You almost hear... Naahhh. A radioactive
FLEERAN cloud can't giggle, can it?

FLEETXT You are not sure how, but you manage to get away.  You brush the
FLEETXT glowing dust from your body in a panic.  You can only hope that the
FLEETXT Decon procedures back at the base will handle the radiation that
FLEETXT covered you from head to toe.  'Next time', you think to yourself,
FLEETXT 'I am going to hotfoot it away as soon as I see one of those'

KILLHIM You are knocked over as the air elemental bursts with the pent up
KILLHIM force of a small hurricane.  Apparently whatever radioactive
KILLHIM energy gave it life has dissipated.  Quite a battle though.
