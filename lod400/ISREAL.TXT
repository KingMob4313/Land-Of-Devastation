;This is where I have decided to place the "isreal" monsters. It is a standard
;monster file, just lik monster.txt. To enable it, you should have the line
;"MONSTER ISREAL.TXT" specified in dataset.txt (you can have as many monster
;text files as you wish)
;
;What are isreal? Isreal's are monsters that are tied to a record in the
;user file ("ISREAL x" specifies that this monster is the real player in
;record x).
;
;Since they function very similar to a normal player, an ISReal has the
;following properties:
;
;  - Can be camped (specify the two parameters "CAMPED" and "NORANDOM")
;
;  - Can only be killed once.
;
;  - Experience increases when the isreal kills players.
;
;  - ISReal may gain money by accepting player surrenders.
