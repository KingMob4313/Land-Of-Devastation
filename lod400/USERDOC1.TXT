Land Of Devastation
By Scott M. Baker

Objective
---------
      What are you here to do? How do you win the Game? What is the meaning
  of life? For answers to these questions, please see the game objective
  command in the documentation center.

Weapons
-------
      Weapons are a necessary tool of survival. It should be understood that
  there are many evil creatures who lurk within the wastelands. They will do
  their best to kill you, so you better be prepared with some force of
  your own.

      There are two primary types of weapons:

      RANGED WEAPONS are used at a distance when you first sight your
  opponent. You have about enough time to get one shot off before close
  close combat begins. (These are also referred to as LONG RANGE WEAPONS)

      CLOSE COMBAT WEAPONS are used in hand-to-hand situations where you
  must physically strike your enemy in order to inflict damage. These are
  often bladed instruments, occasionally charged with energy to inflict
  more damage. (These are also referred to as SHORT RANGE WEAPONS)

      Both types of weapons can be purchased from the supply station at
  Sacre Base as well as "acquired" from monsters in the wasteland.

      IMPORTANT: The amount of damage done by your close combat weapon is
  also dependent on your strength. As a general rule, as your strength
  doubles, your damage infliction will increase by approximately 30%. This
  applies only to close combat weapons; long range weapons are not affected
  by your strength.

Close Combat Weapons
--------------------

KNIFE
      This is pretty lame. Sort of a cross between a butter knife and a steak
  knife, it doesn't inflict much damage. However, if you're on a budget, it is
  better than nothing.

DAGGER
      Basically, the Knife designed specifically for combat use.

SWORD
      If you don't know what a sword is, go back to grade school....

RAZORLANCE
      The lance is a special variation of a spear. It has razor sharp blades
  on both ends. The user usually holds the lance from the middle and can twirl
  it in many directions, hitting the attacker with the blades mounted on each
  end.

ELECTROBLADE
      The electroblade is a dagger that has been electrically charged. It
  gets it's power from a POWER PACK and when the target is struck, the
  electrical charge dissipates into them, doing enhanced damage. This weapon
  does require ammo (POWER PACKS) and will do reduced damage without them.

ELECTROSWORD
      The electrosword is an electrically charged version of the sword. Like
  the electroblade, it require POWER PACK ammo to function.

ELECTROLANCE
      The electrolance is the electrically charged companion of the razor
  lance. When properly loaded with a power pack, it can do massive amounts of
  damage.

NEUTRON SABRE
      A recent experimental prototype using Neutron technology. The Neutron
  sabre is a sword-type weapon that uses neutron energy to charge its
  blade. Produces an intense burning effect on whatever it hits. Uses
  NEUTRON PACKs as armor.

Ranged Weapons
--------------

CROSSBOW
      A purely manually operated weapon. The operator pulls back the string,
  sets in a crossbow bolt, aims and fires. It requires crossbow bolts for
  ammunition.

CLIP PISTOL
      A 9mm clip pistol. You slap a clip in, take aim, and blast a hole in
  your enemy. Uses 9mm clips for ammo.

PHASER-1
      A hand held phaser weapon. Sends a charged proton beam into the enemy.
  Requires power packs for ammo.

PHASER-2
      More powerful version of phaser-1.

PHASER-3
      More powerful version of phaser-2.

COMP BLASTER
      The most powerful power-pack weapon built. Similar to a phaser, but
  uses higher efficiency circuitry to achieve a stronger effect.

GRAVBLASTER
      This weapon sends a beam of gravitons against the target. The gravitons
  create an immense gravitational disruption in the target's cells, causing
  the gravitational forces to rip his cell structure apart. Uses gravblast
  clips.

PLASMABLASTER
      Sends plasma energy into the enemy. Uses plasma clips for ammo.

NEUTRON RIFLE
      Experimental prototype. Uses Neutron packs as ammunition to produce
  massive damage on whatever it hits.

GRENADE PACK
      This is a package of grenades. It is neither a long range nor a close
  range weapon. When you enter combat, you have the choice of throwing a
  grenade at your foe instead of firing a weapon. Grenades have the advantage
  of almost always hitting the opponent and their damage can go right through
  an opponent's armor.

Ammunition
----------
      Certain weapons require ammunition to operate. Ammunition is
  available at the ammunition store at Sacre Base. The following chart
  lists the various ammunition types and what weapons require them. (Note:
  Certain weapons found in the wasteland are unknown to the technicians
  at Sacre Base and therefore may not appear in this chart)

Type 1: Crossbow Bolts     SR: None
                           LR: Crossbow

Type 2: 9mm clip           SR: None
                           LR: Clip Pistol, Uzi 9mm

Type 3: Power Pack         SR: Electroblade, Electrosword, Electrolance
                           LR: Phaser-1,2,3 Comp Blaster

Type 4: Grav Pack          SR: None known
                           LR: GravBlaster

Type 5: Plasma Pack        SR: None known
                           LR: PlasmaBlaster

Type 6: Neutron Pack       SR: Neutron Sabre
                           LR: Neutron Rifle

      Rumor has it that there is also a class of ammo out there known as
  "Cells". Little is known about this ammunition except that it is capable
  of storing much energy and somehow capable of supplying this energy in
  different forms (i.e. Power Pack energy, Neutron energy, etc). The
  whereabouts of this ammunition is not known.

Misc. Items
-----------

RADIO
      This two-way field radio can be used to tie into the base's
  communications system. You can send and leave messages just as if you were
  sitting in the safe comfort of the base.

LR SCAN
      The LR Scan is a very useful device. What it does is tie into the ZR327L
  military surveillance satellite and generate a satellite picture of the
  surrounding terrain. Very handy if you get yourself lost.

MEDICAL KIT
      The medical kit contains a number of self-contained "healing" drugs.
  One quick shot from one of these drugs can do wonders for a person's
  injuries. (These wonder drugs were actually created in 1973, but held up
  in various government agencies for 70 or so years)

RATIONS
      A package of poorly tasting, but very nourishing troop rations. Mostly
  gathered from the remains of dead beasts, it tastes pretty bad, but is
  very necessary to your survival.

SCANNER
      This is a hand-help radar scanning unit. It can give you a quick idea
  of the type of terrain around you as well as locate prominent establishments
  such as towns.

STEALTH FIELD GENERATOR
      The SFG is a unique product of modern technology. It allows you to create
  a field around your person which can either interfere positively (amplify)
  or negatively (cancel out) the noise that you create. Since many of the
  wasteland creatures are dependant upon noise as a means of locating
  targets, you can either increase or decrease your encounter chances with this
  device.

LAPTOP
      The GS-224 Laptop is a very valuable instrument when equipped with the
  necessary programs. You can buy a laptop at sacre base as well as software
  for the laptop. I'll leave it to you to discover what the laptop does. (Try
  talking to TROY HADLEY at the Sacre Base Tavern)

PYLON KEY
      There are several "pylons" scattered around the wasteland. For quite
  some time, the residents of Sacre Base have known how to make these keys.
  The key will let you into the pylon, but beware, many a person who has
  entered a pylon has not returned.

MINIRAFT
      In case you should need to cross some rivers or lakes, then the
  Miniraft may be of some use to you.

Medical Lining
--------------
      Medical lining is a special suit that you wear inside your armor. It is
  kind of an automated medkit. While you are moving about, the medical lining
  pumps you full of chemicals, increasing your hit points as you move.
      Medical lining is rated in hit points per 50 moves. So 5/50 medline
  would be one hit point regenerated per every 10 moves.
      The following classes of medical lining are available:

      STD. MEDLINE: 1/50  (1 hit regenerated per 50 moves)
      ADV. MEDLINE: 5/50  (1 hit regenerated per 10 moves)

LAPTOP and ROMs
---------------

      The GS-224 laptop was specially designed to assist adventurers out in
  the wasteland. It is capable of performing a variety of useful function.
  The basic Laptop come pre-configured with only the essential commands. To
  add new programs to your laptop, you will have to purchase or otherwise
  obtain "ROM Cartridges". ROM Cartridges may be copied with the laptops
  "COPY" command.

      We highly suggest purchasing the Laptop and the following ROMs as soon
  as it is convenient for you:

      NOTES:    Keeps an online notebook of the locations of important places
                that you visit.

      CSTATS:   Extremely handy. Displays useful information about your
                weapons, armor, and other combat statistics. Can be used to
                scan your inventory to find out which weapons are better
                than others.

      DIET:     An automatic diet maintenance program. No more worrying about
                when to each rations.

      APPRAISE: Displays the relative costs of items in your inventory. Costs
                displayed are the "new purchase price" and the price paid by
                Sacre Base may be significantly less. The APPRAISE ROM is
                nevertheless a useful tool in determining what items are
                valuable and what is not.

      For more information about the Laptop and it's ROMs, we suggest you
  visit the Sacre Base Tavern. There is usually someone there who can be
  of assistance.


WasteLands Commands
-------------------
      North...: N or 8     Pick Up Item: P     Enter.........: G
      South...: S or 2     Drop Item...: D     Camp out here.: A
      East....: E or 6     Check Status: C     Construct fort: F
      West....: W or 6     Equip.......: Q     Enter Fort....: I
      Look....: L or 5     Use Item....: U     Inv Maint.....: M
      Kill Obj: K          Quick Heal..: Y     B.A.D. Spell..: B

      Most of those commands are self-explanatory, but a few of them deserve
  some special mentioning:

      ENTER (g)

        The enter command will not only get you into towns, but other
        locations as well - fortresses, camps, special places, pylons,
        whatever. When in doubt about a new location, you might as well try
        to enter it.

      KILL OBJ (k)

        This command will allow you to permanently "kill" an object on the
        wasteland. For example, if there is a "dagger" laying in front of
        sacre base and it has been annoying you, you can kill it.

      EQUIP (e)

        You need to use this one to equip your weapons, armor, etc.

      USE ITEM (u)

        This is one of the most important commands in the game. You can
        use this command to use any usable (i.e. Laptop, rations, medkit,
        etc) items in your inventory.

      QUICK HEAL (y)

        Rather than use the USE (u) command multiple times on a medkit to
        heal yourself, you can use the Y command to automatically use as
        many medkit doses as are necessary to heal you.

      PICK UP (p)

        There is a special power-user option for those of you carrying
        energy cells (Vortex cell, kralox cell, etc). If you type the
        word "cell" at the item number prompt, then LOD will automatically
        pick up all ammo at the current location and charge your energy
        cell with it.

      "ALL"

        On the Kill obj (K), Pick Up (P), and Drop (D) commands, you can
        say "ALL" when prompted for an item number and LOD will attempt the
        command on all available items.

Combat
------
      Combat is a two-phase process. The first phase is when you first sight
  you opponent at a distance.
      Since you are far away, you have the options of running, surrendering,
  throwing grenades, firing your ranged weapon, or proceeding directly to
  close combat. Once you execute one of these options, you will then encounter
  your foe at hand-to-hand combat. Let's discuss each of these options:

      LONG RANGE COMBAT
          This simply fires your ranged weapon at the enemy. Ranged weapons
       usually require ammo and if yours doesn't have any, you cannot use
       this option.

      CLOSE COMBAT (hand-to-hand)
          This will bypass you long range combat options and proceed directly
       to close (hand-to-hand) combat.

      THROW GRENADE
          Basically, you throw your grenade at the enemy.

      RUN
          You attempt to use the age old strategy of running away. If your
       enemy has no ranged weapons, he will probably let you go. But, if the
       enemy does have a ranged weapon, he may try to take a shot at you.

      SURRENDER
          Give him half of your money and he'll probably let you go.

      VIEW OPPONENT
          See what your up against.

      VIEW CHARACTER
          See how pitiful your current status is.

      STRIKE UP CONVERSATION
          For some monsters that look somewhat talkative, this option will
       appear and you can talk to the monster. Odds are you can't talk him
       out of killing you, but you may be able to gain some vital information
       from the monster.

      BUY ITEM
          Sometimes, you'll notice that a particular enemy has an item that
       would be of value to you. Rather than fight for it, you may opt for the
       more civilized approach of buying the item. However, monsters are not
       usually as generous as the Sacre Base supply station and their
       prices may be quite high!

Close Combat
------------
      Most of your encounters will most likely lead to close combat. Close
  combat is mostly a skill of knowing when to run and when to fight. Some
  monsters will simply be stronger than you. You may have to run or surrender
  in order to preserve your life. However, in instances where you choose to
  fight, the following options are available:

      ATTACK
          Charge at the monster with your weapon; Inflict as much damage
          as possible while protecting yourself from injury.

      BERSERK
          Commit yourself to fighting until death. No aborting! You'll
          receive a minimal (about 10%) combat advantage when berserking,
          but you lose all chance of stopping in case you begin to lose!

      SURRENDER
          Give him some money and hope he goes away.

      RUN
          Try to run away. Monster may attempt to block you or shoot you if
          you run.

      VIEW OPPONENT
          See what kind of a mess you are getting yourself into....

      VIEW CHARACTER
          Check how bad you are losing....

      WARP
          If you are carrying a warper, you can push it's button and get
       out of combat fast!

      After each combat round, you will be informed what your health and the
  monster's health is. When your hit points reach zero, you die!

Attributes
----------
      Your character has four basic attributes. These are strength (STR),
  dexterity (DEX), agility (AGL), and health (HITS). These attributes combine
  to form your basic physical self.

      STRENGTH
          Strength effects how hard you can hit with your weapons. The higher
       your strength, the more damage you will do in hand-to-hand combat.

      DEXTERITY
          Your ability to hit what you are aiming at. Your dexterity is put
       up against the enemy's agility. The higher your dexterity is compared
       to his agility, the more often you will hit.

      AGILITY
          Your ability to run away and dodge attacks.

      HEALTH/HITS
          Your current hit points are your life. When they reach zero, you
       die.


Experience and Levels
---------------------
      You will gain experience as you fight in combat and/or complete special
  quests. Every so often, you will gain enough experience to "go up a level."
  By rising a level, your characters attributes will increase. The experience
  requirements per level are summarized below:

               Level          Experience
               -----          ----------
                 1                     0
                 2                  1250
                 3                  2500
                 4                  5000
                 5                 10000
                 6                 20000
                 7                 40000
                 8                 80000
                 9                160000
                10                320000
                11                480000
                12                640000
                13                800000
                14                960000

      When you have enough experience to go up a level, return to Sacre Base
  and you will have the option of training for various statistics. Note: You
  may only be trained at Sacre Base; other wasteland cities will most likely
  not train you.

      When training, you may allocate your training points however you wish
  to Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Hit Points, or trade training points for
  cash.


Team Play
---------
      From time to time, it has been noticed that soldiers have grouped
  themselves together to form "teams". These teams provide a number of
  benefits:

      1) Smart Mines which are placed by one team member will not explode
         when another member enters the area.

      2) Team members will be able to see each others fortresses using
         the fortlist ROM as well as teleport to each others fortresses
         without any fee (regardless of the list-with-traders-union
         option)

      3) Teams with 2 or more members will get an automatic 5% team discount
         at all city stores.

      4) Team members can bypass other teammate's fortress TOLL and PROX
         systems without harm.

      Options for teams are located at the troop quarters menu.


Taxes
-----
      Although much of the previous civilization was destroyed by the great
  nuclear war, one custom has survived: Tax Collection. For some unknown
  reason, the political leaders of each of the wastelands towns have all
  agreed to charge players level 10 or above taxes. These taxes will be
  re-distributed nightly to all players.

      So what does this mean to you? If you are level 10 or above, then
  expect to be charged tax whenever you buy something. And, if the log
  says taxes were re-distributed, then check your normal account (located
  in the investment options section of the troop quarters) for your
  nightly cut.


Fortresses
----------
      Fortresses may be constructed by the prosperous adventurer. There are
  several reasons a fortress is useful and several purposes a fortress can
  serve:

      A PLACE TO HIDE OUT
          The wasteland isn't a very nice place. Hiding out in your fortress
          can be a great defence against monsters and "competitive" players.

      STORAGE VAULT
          Every fortress includes a storage vault. You can drop off as many
          objects as you like. As long as your fortress remains intact, your
          valuables are safe.

      SELLING MEDKITS/AMMO and ITEMS
          You can designate portions of your medical doses on hand and/or
          energy on hand to be "for sale". Players may then visit your
          fortress and purchase medkits/ammo for the price that you decide.

          If you pick a good location and set your prices right, players
          may opt to shop your at your fortress rather than a pricey
          town. If your fort is equipped with an energy-producing reactor,
          then you can make a healthy profit selling energy!

          All forts are equipped with a "sales counter" capable of holding
          any eight standard devices. You decide what to sell and what
          price to sell it at. Someone in dire need of a Warper may pay
          you a healthy price for one!

          It should be noted that when trading, other players are held outside
          the gates of your fortress. They aren't allowed access to your
          vault, treasury, etc.

      AVOID RENT
          If you are a level eight player or above, then you have probably
          already realized that if you stay in any of the towns, you will be
          charged rent. And this rent does get expensive.

          So, the solution - build your own base and stay in there. It's
          safer than hanging out on the wastelands and you don't have to
          shell out the cash to pay rent every day.

      FACTORIES
          You can install factories in your fort for producing a variety
          of items such as mines. A factory produces one item per night and
          can pay for itself very quickly!

      SCAVENGERS
          A special "scavenger droid" has been developed especially for
          fortress use. Each night, the scavenger droid will venture outside
          your fortress and locate any "junk" laying around. The scavenger
          droid will sell these items as salvage at 10% of full price!

      All that sounds pretty nice, doesn't it? Well, it sounds nice to just
  about everyone else as well. So the point is, you'd better protect your
  fortress pretty well or somebody uninvited will move in! (and move you
  out!) Fortress defensive options:

      MOAT
          You can dig a moat around your fortress. When somebody wants to
          attack, they'll have to get through it. Several different moats
          are available - from simple water with a crocodile to flesh-
          dissolving acid!

      DEFENSE FIELD
          Every fortress should purchase a defense field immediately. The
          defense field is essentially the fortress's "hit points". When
          an attacker defeats the defense field, he is inside. Defense fields
          recharge before battle from the fortress's energy stores.

          Also, do note that if your base runs out of energy, then there will
          be nothing to recharge your defense field if you are attacked.

      WEAPON
          So what happens while somebody is hacking away at your defense
          field? You have a big gun that shoots at him. The better the
          fortress weapon, the more damage will be inflicted as the attacker
          attempts to beat the defense field.

      REACTOR
          All this stuff takes power. Your defense field requires energy
          to recharge, your base weapon requires energy to fire, etc. So you
          might want to have a reactor to build up your daily energy
          supply.

      MINE SPREADER
          These nifty items will take any mines from your forts storage room
          and scatter them around your fortress in a random manner. Very
          useful for automatically creating mine fields.

      PROX SENSORS
          Proximity sensors - Your fort is equipped with a weapon, right?
          Well, why not blast everyone who walks by!!! The Prox sensor will
          let you set your fortress weapon to attack all players who come
          within a pre-determined distance of your fort.

      TOLL STATIONS
          Prox sensors are nice, but there isn't much profit in just blasting
          people. How about charging them a "toll" fee. If they pay, they
          can continue unharmed. If not..... BLAM!

      FORTRESS SFG (Stealth Field Generator)
          Hides your fortress from the view of adjacent map cells. The only
          way someone can see your fortress is by pratically standing right
          on top of it!

      Now, the most important thing you have to worry about is supplying your
  base with energy. Without energy, your base defense field cannot charge and
  your weapon cannot fire. So, how do you get energy?

       METHOD #1:
          Buy, steal, or otherwise "acquire" ammunition packs. Take the ammo
          packs into your fortress configuration room and discharge them
          into the fortress power banks.

          Any type of energy-based ammunition will do - Power Packs, Grav
          Packs, etc. But the projectile-ammo is useless (how would you
          discharge some crossbow bolts???)

       METHOD #2:
          Buy a reactor (described above) and it will generate a generous
          amount of energy each day.

      Note: You will want to make sure you place a lot of energy in your
  fortress when you create it -- There is a tactic becoming increasingly
  popular where players will lay siege to a fort by repeatedly attacking
  it and running from it, thus draining the fortresses energy reserves
  and making it vulnerable to attack!

Fortress Trading
----------------
      As mentioned above, trading is possible with fortresses. By using the
  FORTRESS TRADE CONTROL menu, you can set various options about what you
  wish to buy or sell. Here are some quick hints:

      SELLING HEALING (MEDKIT) DOSES
          First you'll have to "dump" a medkit into your fortress medkit
          supply. You can do this from the fortress configuration menu. Then
          go back to the fortress trading menu and you can decide how much of
          your medkit stocks you wish to put up for sale and how much you
          wish to charge per dosage.

      SELLING ENERGY (Power Packs)
          Like with medkits, go into the fortress configuration menu and
          dump some energy into the fortress energy banks (unless you already
          have a plentiful supply of energy in the banks). Then go back
          to the fortress trade menu and select how much energy you wish to
          sell and at what price. Don't sell all your energy, because you
          would leave your base defenseless.

      BUYING/SELLING THE THREE PRODUCTS (minerals, herbs, fuel)
          Not fully implemented yet. Feel free to experiment with the options.

      THE SALES COUNTER
          Each base has a sales counter. The base owner may place up to eight
          items in this sales counter. Other players may then come and buy
          them from the base.

      SELLING TELEPORTATION
          If you equip your base with a teleporter, then you can charge other
          players to use your teleporter. You will receive money both when
          players depart from and arrive to your base. (Note: You may wish
          to use the "List with traders union" so people know where your
          base is)

Communicating
-------------
      Land of Devastation includes some interactive communications capabilities
  which allow you to "talk" to various characters. When talking to a character,
  the character will respond to various "hot words" - for instance, asking
  someone about "JOB" or "NAME" will usually get them to respond with the
  appropriate information.

Special Quests
--------------
      There are several different special quests which can be accomplished
  out in the wastelands. A quest could be as simple as delivering a special
  item to a certain place or as complicated as having to locate and slay
  a particular monster.
      It's up to you to discover what these quests are! Completing a special
  quest usually has the following benefits:

      1) An experience point bonus.

      2) Accumulation of quest points - gives you a certain amount of
         "prestige" in the quest points section of the rankings.

      3) A special item - many quests result in you gaining a special item
         or learning a useful clue about the game.

Terrain
-------
 Plains         --   Wide, open grasslands; Usually quite safe.
 Impass. Mtn    MM   Impassable mountains. No way to get around em!
 Desert         ..   Hot temps and dust storms make travelling dangerous.
 Mountains      mm   Low mountains; Easily climbable, but not too safe.
 Road           ||   Pre-war highways - monsters usually stay clear.
 Wasteland      ww   Areas severely damaged by nuclear radiation - stay clear!
 River          ~~   Flowing water - usually easy to cross.
 Swamp          ""   Swamps - very unsafe.
 Rad-zone       rr   Direct nuclear strike. Very, very hazardous
 Forest         ff   Thick, woody forests.
 Hut            HT   Small huts occupied by rural dwellers
 Towns          xx   Relatively safe if you're friends with the residents.
 U-Pylon        /\   Several located, but their function is unknown.
 D-Pylon        /\   Several located, but their function is unknown.
 Hort. Center   HS   True nature unknown; Rumored to exist.

 Kill, Inc      KI   True nature unknown; Rumored to exist.
 Comm Tower     CT   True nature unknown; Rumored to exist.



Inside the cities
-----------------
      You start out in the city of Sacre Base. Sacre Base is your home - the
  most friendly city out there. You will usually find a good selection of
  items to purchase and pretty decent prices.

      However, other settlements have developed further out in the
  wastelands. These cities have evolved their own cultures and customs and
  in most cases, have a selection of unique, hard to find, items in their
  stores.

      Most of the cities include a local "Tavern" which serves as a place
  to communicate with the local residents. Talking to people in ther taverns
  can be a valuable source of income.



Financial Options
-----------------
  (please see financial options in the documentation center)


Getting Started
---------------
   1) Examine your character

        a) Use the "C" (check character) command at one of the menus.

        b) You should notice that you are probably carrying a medkit
           and a pack of rations. These will be necessary to sustain your
           life out in the wastelands.

   2) Equip Your Character

        a) Visit the short range weapons store and pick up the best short
           range weapon that you can afford. This should be a Sword.

        b) If you have any money left, then head over to the misc store
           and pick up whatever supplies you can afford - it's always good
           to have a spare medkit on hand.

        c) Go into the wasteland and use the "Q" (equip) command to select
           the dagger as your hand-to-hand weapon.

   2) Fight some monsters

        a) Go into the wasteland.

        b) Explore the area around Sacre Base. Try not to get to far away
           from the base since you don't want to get lost.

        c) When you encounter some "easy" monsters (such as a rad hound,
           giant rat, ant man), waste them! Go into hand-to-hand combat and
           you should be able to defeat them.

        d) If you encounter a "hard" monster (such as an Insane Soldier
           or a Scavenger), run away immediately. Your odds of beating them
           are very slim.

        e) If your hit points run low, use your medkit to heal them back up.
           You can use the "Y" (quick heal) command or the "U" (use) command
           to use a medkit.

        f) When you have accumulated 2000 experience or you are out of medkit
           dosages, head back to the base. If you have the 2000 or so
           experience, then you should go up a level.

   3) Equip your character with better weapons.

        a) Buy at least one more medkit/10; You'll need them when you go out
           again.

        b) Depending on your amount of cash, buy a better hand-to-hand weapon,
           armor, long-range weapon, and ammo if necessary.

        c) When you feel you're ready, purchase a Laptop and some programs
           for it. The DIET and NOTES programs are pretty nice to have.

   4) That's it - you're on your own from now!

@@GTERM
Gterm: The LOD EGA Graphic Terminal
-----------------------------------

       In case you aren't using Gterm at this time, then this document is
provided to explain GTERM's benefits, requirements, and capabilities. If
you are using GTERM, then you need not read this file.

GTERM REQUIREMENTS

       First of all, we need to make sure your machine is equipped to run
GTERM. You need:

       VIDEO: EGA 640x350x16 or above (i.e. EGA,VGA,SVGA,etc)
       RAM:   about 384k or so
       DISK:  around a meg free to be on the safe side
       MODEM: 2400+ recommended
       CPU:   8mhz 286 or above recommended, but should work on 8088 also.

WHAT IS GTERM?

       What is Gterm? Well, it is an EGA graphical terminal for the Land Of
Devastation door game. Basically, it takes the plain ascii/ansi interface
and adds some nice graphics to enhance playing. Instead of seeing little ".."
and "MM" symbols for the wastelands map, you will see 16 color ega pictures
in their place.
       GTERMs graphics basically cover two areas: The map grid and the
inventory display. Is explained above, the map grid will display the map
in full EGA color with none of those bland looking symbols. Similarly, the
inventory display will show you pictures of your inventory rather than
simple text.
       GTERM also includes a few other utilities - a rankings capture, LR
scan capture, and a rankings profile to name a few. These are explained
further in the GTERM documentation.
       It should also be noted that on an 8mhz+ machine, display may be
actually FASTER than the normal text. The graphical interface uses a
binary method to transfer data between LOD and GTERM versus the text method
used by a normal terminal program.

SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF USING GTERM

       1] As stated above, your map display and inventory listings will
          be displayed using EGA pictures rather than text symbols.

       2] Certain ANSI displays used in LOD (i.e. the color menus and such)
          are also stored with GTERM. LOD can "call up" these pictures so
          they will appear instantly rather than having to send all of the
          ANSI data across the modem. For 2400 baud and below users, this
          is a great speed up.

       3] A few miscellaneous utilities - a rankings capture, a rankings
          profile capture, etc.

       4] In many cases, playing using GTERM on a slow modem (i.e. 2400
          or lower) will result in faster game play.

       5] Monster pictures - we have drawn up several nice pictures of the
          monsters which you encounter out in the wastelands. These EGA
          pictures pop up over the map window to show you our idea of
          what you are fighting. We've got about 20 of them drawn with
          more pouring in all the time!

       6] ADLIB/SOUNDBLASTER support. GTERM supports full MOD music. There
          is quite a large musical score for LOD, composed primarily by
          Chris Azure.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SET UP GTERM?

       Basically, the simplest way to set up GTERM is by installing it as
an "external protocol" to your terminal program. Then, just select that
protocol when you go into LOD and you will be up and running in full EGA
color.

WHERE CAN YOU GET GTERM?

       Most boards that have LOD up for download also have GTERM sitting
around somewhere. If you can't find it or you want the most recent version,
then you may contact the authors bbs at:

@@USERNEW
Whats New!

This file is intended for players and will contain a listing of major
playing differences from previous versions. This is for players who have
played before and want to know what has changed that will effect
them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Version 4.00]

For REGISTERED systems ONLY: Find the new ACME weapons store. There are
cool new weapons plus a full-time gunsmith on hand to make some unique new
mods to your existing weapons. [Somone at the Death Warrior HQ may be able
to give directions]

Those in need of the Puritron CPU might find interest in knowing that Loki
has it. This quest is somewhat more involved than previous puritron quests,
so be prepared to think a little more. Seek out one of Loki's High Priests
for an item that might be used to summon Loki himself.

Visit Defs Sacre in the Sacre Base Tavern and inquire about the elementals.
You won't regret it.

Form teams! All stores will now give teams with 2 or more members a 5% team
discount.

The Scanner device has been revised. It is now much more useful and reports
bearings correctly.

Take a look at the laptop commands "help" and (if you have it) "cstats".

I raised the default experience table quite a bit for higher level
characters. People beyond level 8 will notice a difference.

Experience for zone 3 + monsters has been tightened up a bit to slow down
advancement of mega-huge players.

Massive changes to fortresses. Many new items available, expanded trading
potential, etc.

(Default Dataset) Users may only train ("go up a level") at Sacre Base.
Other cities (Freedom City, DWHQ, whatever) just don't have the knowlede,
resources, or the desire to train you.

(Default Dataset) The Sacre Base section has been changed around a bit to
spice things up a little.

(Default Dataset) Terra Labs is now out there.... try to find it and it's
supply of Ultrawarpers, Ultrachargers, and Ultracloaks!

[Version 3.80]

If you die and chose to CREATE a new character rather than restarting
from a saved clone, then your saved clone (if you have one) will be lost
forever.

Mines now have a "warning" feature which can be turned on or off.

EMWarp programs have been shown to occasionally "malfunction" when a mine
goes off!

Kill, Inc may have some new items in stock....

Those having trouble crossing the lava river near Xeboc's lair may wish to
seek the location of the Fang Gang City, Blood Lust. There is someone there
who can provide you with a clue about what to do next.

Talking with the Horticulture Center manager again my provide some insight
into one of the new special quests.


[Version 3.70]

Internal bug fixes & cosmetic upgrades.

A few more people in the taverns....

A new ROM you might be able to find.

When the puritron is found, the wasteland will be "cleansed" of impurities.

Players with fortresses should find many new and interesting items available
at the fortress stores!

The character display has been improved to look a bit better. Users who
prefer the older display may set their preference using the ansi options
menu in the troop quarters.

Fortresses will now let their owners enter without a password requirement.

The final encounter with Xeboc may bit a bit more difficult than you
expected.

Towns now carry specific inventories.

During a storm that lasted several weeks, several lakes were formed onto
the wasteland. (well, how else do you want me to explain this???!!!)

Reports of a few new towns were detected.

The people of Freedom City have just gotten a bit more particular about their
visiters.


[Version 3.60]

Sound support added! See the documentation for the new GTERM and LOD
versions for information on how to add sound.

Fixed a few internal bugs.

Lots of new graphics added to GTERM and GAMEEGA!


[Version 3.51]

Fixed a few bugs that managed to get into 3.50.


[Version 3.50]

Many small bug fixes and cosmetic changes.

Fixed the problem with armor not working correctly. Armor deflection
percentages will now work as they were intended.

The C-Stats program has been improved slightly. It will now show a
difficulty level of the monster you are fighting at the long range
combat menu prompt.


[Version 3.40]

Mostly more minor bug fixes.


[Version 3.31]

Minor bug fixes.


[Version 3.30]

Players at level ten and above may start getting taxed. The taxes
collected will be re-distributed at maintenance so that the lower players
get some money.

Team Support Added! Please see the User Docs for a complete discussion
of team play!

Placed a limit on the number of fortress attacks per day. (default limit
is 15 - but can be changed by the sysop). This should keep weak players
from attacking a large fortress 500 times to get through it's defenses.


[Version 3.21]

This release was mainly just a minor bug fix.

Fixed bug with log file reporting the wrong information in player combat.
(log would occasionally report both players were killed when only one
was)

[Version 3.20]

A bunch of the pylon codes got changed around, so don't be surprised if
a code takes you to a different destination.

You can now discharge any type of ammunition pack into a fortress, not
just power packs.

I typed in all of the names of the inventory items that were showing up
as "unknown" in version 3.00/3.01 when using GAMEEGA and/or GTERM. Because
of this, I suggest all users that are using old GTERMs upgrade to the
latest version, otherwise the inventory display [F2] will be slightly
messed up.

If you're level 8 or above and staying overnight in any of the towns, then
you are going to get charged rent! And it aint cheap!

It's been rumored that a few new "black market" items have appeared at
the EEEE.

Player vs Player combat completed! You can now waste anyone who is
camping out in the wasteland!

Added a small power-user option to the pick-up command. If you type "cell"
at the object number prompt and you have a vortex/kralox/vitron cell,
then LOD will automatically pick up and charge the cell with ammo at
your location.

A minor change to the notes program will cause it to duplicate your
existing data when you re-enter the locations you were at previously.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


[Version 3.01]

Till Death changed to Berserk - a 10% advantage is gained by berserking.


[Version 3.00]

The Puritron routines are completed and the game can now be won!

If you've defeated Xeboc, you might want to go and waste him again.... But
hurry. Others may get there first!

Likewise, it may be a good time to visit ol' Mr. Kirk again! He may have
something important for you this time.

There's a nuclear missile silo out there which may be interesting to some
users. Try search for a new pylon to find it.

For those who liked the autonav program, but it got too slow, it's been
speeded up, so give it a shot!

Don't try to put more than $25 million in your game or normal accounts or
you'll get taxed!


[Version 2.10]

This version was mostly a cosmetic/bug fix update so there are not too many
important changes since 2.00. Basically, we have some more EGA, some more
ANSI, the GTERM users get a few nifty displays, etc.

The bank has been upgraded. There is now a "game account" and a loan option
which will let you borrow money in times of need.

One major addition is the new CLONE CENTER. You should find it located
somewhere around Sacre Base. It will allow you to create up to one "clone"
of yourself. If you die, then you can restart from this saved clone
rather than using the R]essurect or C]reate new options.


[Version 2.00]

Many, many changes. There were so many file structure changes that your
sysop had to reset the game (assuming you were playing a previous-2.00
game). My apologies; It was my fault for not bothering to write a
conversion utility.

Map format changed - rather than 32x32x10, we are now 125x125. This was
done for several reasons. Mainly, the unrealisticness of the old
system. The "holes" are gone and have been replaced with "pylons". You
can figure out how to use them.

Since there are no "map levels" anymore, monsters are all on level one.
Which means there are some real nasties you could run into out there. The
monsters now work by a "distance" system. Meaning the easy monsters will
be close to sacre base. The difficult monsters will be far away. The farther
you go from sacre base, the worse monsters, you'll encounter.

More laptop progs - You can now get the scanner/lrscan programs for
your laptop so you don't have to carry those two around as well.

A few new weapons which you can buy at Sacre Base. Most importantly,
a series of "Neutron Weapons" have been added. These were added for those
mega-players who have lots of money but nothing to spend it on.

Special Quests! Talking to people in the taverns may get you started on
one or two of them.

Base sales - Bases now have a "sales counter" where you may place
various items in your base storage room up for sale. People may then
come and buy the weapons and the money will be deposited in your fortress's
treasury.

Aux. Weapon. You can now designate an auxiliary weapon and E]xchange between
it and your normal weapon in combat. For example, you could use a ammo-
requiring weapon (i.e. like an electrosword) most of the time, but have
a normal (i.e. dagger) weapon ready in case you run out of ammo.

"ALL". When you use the Get/Kill/Drop commands in the wasteland, you may
say "ALL" and LOD will perform the operation on all available items.

Three combat modes are implemented - Statistical, Alpha, and reflex. You
can choose one inside troop quarters.

Base teleporters finally installed. You can buy one and then set a price
and charge other users for use of your teleporter.
@@USERQCK
[QuickStart Docs]

With every game, there are those people who will not take the time to
read the game docs before playing... This file is for them!

GENERAL INFO:

Ok. LOD is your basic RPG. You start out in Sacre Base where you may
buy/sell weapons, talk to people, etc.

You start out with a few thousand bucks, a medkit, and some rations. First
thing you should do is get yourself a weapon. Go to the supply station, then
to the SR (short range) weapons store and buy the best you can afford.

Make sure to EQUIP your new weapon either in the T]roop quarters menu or
once you get to the wasteland.

Then go out into the wasteland and kick some butt. Stay close to Sacre
Base and remember it's location. The "easy" monsters are around the base. If
you stray away too far, you'll start running into the hard monsters.

Once you've gotten enough money to buy some better equipment (or you run out
of medkit applications), head back to sacre base and stock up.

COMBAT:

Combat is played in two stages; Long range when you first see your enemy and
short range when you are in close combat.

If you don't have a LR weapon, then you can't do a whole lot at long range.
Just hit hand to hand and fight closely.

You can "surrender" by giving your opponent half your money (providing you
have a decent amount of money). Or you can "run" in which your odds are
based on your agility.

That's all of the essentials. I encourage you to go and read the complete
user manual. There is some very important information in it.

@@LODWALK
The following is a little walkthrough of a new player. If you are still
fuzzy about how to play LOD, then the following should help you out a little
bit.

Please note, for space-saving reasons, I have played out the game in LOD's
worst graphics mode - for most, people, you will either be using the enhanced
ANSI display or the full EGA graphics display (with GTERM).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Standby, looking for you...

Look's like you are new here. I'll have to ask a few questions and then you
can be on your way.

What would you like to be called around here?
>Waste-M-All
Waste-M-All, Correct (Y/N) ? y

OK. You're all taken care of now.
You might want to stop by the supply station and pick up some equipment.

News
----
Welcome to version 2.10! Many enhancements for this version. Players will
probably want to go to the documentation menu and have a look at the updates
file.

Remember, the farther you stray from Sacre Base, the worse monsters you will
encounter!

Troop Quarters Selection ]Enter Tavern
Welcome to the Tavern!

You casually enter the Tavern and begin to look around. While you are here,
You notice the following people:

   1> Defs Sacre
   2> Jeffrey
   3> Troy Hadley
   4> Mean Max
   5> Captain Targon

Who do you want to talk to ? 1
Howdy there. NAME's Defs Sacre. I used to be a warrior, but now I've retired
and serve as bartender here at the base. I know lots about MONSTERS, ARMOR,
WEAPONS, etc. What you want to know about?

]name
NAME's Defs Sacre, like I said.

]monsters
The wasteland is populated by many different creatures. Most of the ones
around the base here are pretty wimpy and some are even unarmed. But once you
go farther out, things get real nasty real quick. What MONSTER do you want to
know about?

]ant
ANT Men? They are a strange lot. Kind of a cross between an ANT and a man.
Nobody knows how it happened - probably more radiation caused mutation.

]weapons
I know lots about WEAPONS. What do you want to know about? SHORT range or
LONG range WEAPONS? I also have used some GRENADES in my time.

]short
There are lots of SHORT range WEAPONS. My favorite is the Slicer-Dicer. They
don't sell them around here - I found it on some kinda robot a ways away from
here. Hell of a battle getting the thing.

]bye
Later, dude. Hope to see you again in one piece.

@@FININFO
Financial Options
-----------------
      In the investment options menu of the troop quarters, there are a few
  different financial options that you can perform. These are:

  1] Withdrawing/Depositing money in your "standard account"

     The standard account is a safe investment which will earn you 7% of your
  money per night. Your money is always safe there - it can't be lost, stolen,
  etc.

  2] Withdraw/Deposit money in your "game account"

     The game account is a special account which will earn you 14% per
  day. However, this money is not without risk. Other players can "challenge"
  you to games. They will challenge you for up to 50% of what is in your
  account. If they win, you will gain 50%, if you lose, then you will lose
  50% for them. For example:

    a> Defs Sacre has $500 in his account.

    b> Atlas Eyes challenges for $250. If Atlas Eyes wins the game then he
       will get $250 of Defs Sacre's money. Otherwise, Atlas Eyes will lose
       $250 of his money to Defs Sacre.

    c> Atlas Eyes loses. And Defs Sacre ends up with $750.

    d> maint runs and Defs Sacre earns 14% interest on his $750, bringing his
       total up to $1000. Not bad!

  3] Request a loan

     You may request a lone from the bank. They will usually loan you up to
  5% of your worth. Each day the amount you are required to pay back will
  rise by 18%. They will get increasingly upset if you do not pay this
  off very quickly.

  4] Pay off loan

     You can pay off as much of your loan as you wish at any time. Paying off
  your loan is wise as any unpaid balance accumulates 20% interest per
  night.

  5] Financial Statement

     Just summarizes how much money you have (or don't have?)

  6] Financial Info

     A brief summary of the available financial options.

  7] Deposit/Withdraw rent account

     The rent account is a special account that is managed by Hotels-R-Us.
  Here's how it works: The guys at Hotels-R-Us are very nice - they will
  let you stay at any city for FREE until you reach level eight. But, once
  you reach level 8, you will have to start paying rent.

     Each night, an additional rent charge will be added to your account.
  When you get on at your next log on, you should probably pay this charge
  off. If you have not paid by the next time, then Hotels-R-Us will deny
  you access to the city! (although there are some rather unpleasant
  ways to get back into the city).

     Unlike the other two accounts, the rent account can have either a
  surplus or a deficit in it. A deficit (negative money) means that you
  owe Hotels-R-Us and they will get upset if they aren't paid.

     A surplus in the account means that you have extra money there that
  might pay for a few days rent.

     So what does all this mean? It means, once you get to level 8, buy
  a base and live there instead! (If you stay in a base or camp out in the
  wasteland, you are not charged rent)


@@Q&A
Questions and Answers:

Q. When I view a monster, it says his weapons do a certain amount of damage,
   but when I fight him, he hits for many more points!

A. The damage listed for his weapons is the BASE damage level. The actual
   damage is dependent on his strength. For a weak monster, the damage
   done will be less that the weapons rating. For a strong monster, the
   damage will be greater.


Q. How do I get to the lower levels?

A. You don't! Starting with version 2.00 of LOD and up, there is no lower
   map. The top level was increased in size to provide for a more
   realistic game environment.


Q. What are these "special quests" ?

A. They are exactly as the name implies - a few little side adventures
   thrown in to add flavor to the game. Sometimes talking to the residents
   of a town may get you some insight into a quest, otherwise, locating
   and using a special object may help. Remember, always try out all of
   the gadgets you find in the wasteland!


Q. I don't like this "xxx's weapon disintegrates as it falls to the ground"
   stuff. How can I get rid of it?

A. If you're the sysop (or game operator), then you can go into monster.def,
   find the character "DEFAULT_1", go down to the line which says "DESINT 35"
   and change it to a smaller value. The smaller the value, the less the
   chance that weapons, armor, etc will be disintegrated.
