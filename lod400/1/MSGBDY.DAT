       Please encourage your sysop to register this software. LODrespresents many hours of work and I desperately need compenstationto continue the porject. Only through the generosity of responsiblesysops can this project continue.       The requested registration fee is $20. After your sysop sendsin the fee, his personal key will be waiting in about a week on theLOD support bbs (602-544-4655).       If you enjoy LOD, then how about registering it for yoursysop? Or banding together with other users to get together aregistration?       The money really helps out in the way of funding the workon LOD. As many of you know, in addition to working on LOD, I am alsoa full time college student. My time is scarce and I can only continuethis project if I know that there are those out there willing tosupport it.       When registered, the seven second delay upon entering and exitingLOD will go away, plus you will gain access to the new "ACME Weapons"advanced weapons shop located in the wastelands.       Please note: registrations may take a week or so to process,so please don't rag on your sysop too much if the registrationis not processed immediately (call me up and bother me (grin))       Scott Baker, Author of LOD and GTERM.       Hello everyone! This is an automatic message from Scott Baker,author of Land Of Devastation. There have been a few interestingdevelopments lately and I thought I'd outline them.       - Alternate data sets. Many sysops have submitted their customized         data sets to me and I have posted them up on the support bbs. These         custom data sets typically include radical new maps, awesome new         monsters, and devastating new weapons. Tell your sysop to check         them out!       - EGA development kit. A development kit is now available for those         wishing to develop EGA pictures for LOD. It is contained in the         file LODxxxG.ZIP and is available from my support bbs.       - Art contest. Details on the first batch of winners is included in         the EGA kit file, LODxxxG.ZIP. More arrivals are showing up         and we'll have another contest again soon. Much thanks to Dave         Rosson for several new images from him included in this version.       - The official Land of Devastation echo area (echo tag LAND) is now         available on the Fidonet backbone. Have your sysop request it         today!       - LOD newsletter. The LOD newsletter is still under production, under         the direction of Dave Rosson. Dave can be contacted via my bbs         or the LAND echo.       I would like to thank all of you out there for your continued supportof LOD. The vast amount of comments and suggestions that I have receivedhave really helped to make this game a success.       Scott Baker, Author of LOD
