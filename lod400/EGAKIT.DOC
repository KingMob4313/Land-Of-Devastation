EGA Developers kit for LOD
(c) Scott Baker

Purpose

  There are utilities included here to allow you to add your own images to the
  EGA version of LOD and gterm. At this time, you may only add the large
  monster pictures - inventory and map tiles are not available yet.


Required Stuff

  1) A paint program. Although a basic image editor is inclueded
     (editimg.exe), it is virtually useless for designing images. I only
     use it when I have to touch up a small spot. You will need to
     appropriate some kind of image drawing program - such as PC Paintbrush.

  2) A GIF converter. You'll need to get your images into the .GIF format
     before they can be imported into LOD.

  3) A scanner. Not absolutely necessary, but very helpful. All of my artists
     draw their work out by hand, scan it, and then colorize it.

How to do it

  1) Make an image and get it into the .GIF format. MAKE SURE TO USE THE
     PROPER EGA PALETTE. This is up to you - you are the artist! Some hints
     for creating images are available in the file LODART.DOC.

  2) Run GETBIG.EXE. It will prompt you for the filename. MAKE SURE YOUR
     MOUSE DRIVER IS LOADED. Move the mouse so that the colored box appears
     directly over your image. The arrows may be used for fine positioning.

     Press SPACE to capture the image to disk. A short beep should be heard.

     Press ESC to leave the conversion program.

     The image will be saved to GETBIG.DAT. Rename this to whatever you
     want (i.e. MUTANT.DAT)

  3) Use EGAPUT to add your image to the resource file. The exact format
     should be "EGAPUT ADD <FILENAME>", (i.e. EGAPUT ADD MUTANT.DAT)

  4) Edit the MONSTER.TXT file and add a link to your image using the
     COMBATPIC parameter. (i.e. "COMBATPIC MUTANT")

  5) Recompile your dataset with compile.exe.

Required format

  1) The image must be 180 x 120 pixels in size.

  2) The image must USE THE STANDARD 16 COLOR EGA PALETTE, as described
     below.

Notes

  Yes, these docs are currently very poor. I hacked this out in a hurry to
  get the image capture utility to those of you who need it. I have included
  the source code to GETBIG so you can tweek it's performance if you need
  to for some reason.

  GTERM. Adding your images to the RESOURCE.002 file on the sysops end will
  only affect the sysops display. For remote callers to see the EGA pictures,
  you will have to give them an updated RESOURCE.002. Please DO NOT remove
  any images from this file. It will only confuse the poor user if he calls
  another bbs.
