Quick Installation
------------------
     I) Create a directory for the game (example: "MD \LOD")

    II) Unzip the required archives into that directory. You have three
        options:

         a) Unzip LODxxxA.ARJ and LODxxxB.ARJ for the TEXT* version
            of LOD.

         b) Unzip LODxxxA.ARJ, LODxxxB.ARJ, and LODxxxC.ARJ for the
            EGA version of LOD with partial graphics.

         c) Unzip LODxxxA.ARJ, LODxxxB.ARJ, LODxxxC.ARJ, and LODxxxD.ARJ
            for the EGA version of LOD with FULL graphics.

         * Note: Even if you use the TEXT version of LOD, your users
                 may still get EGA graphics using GTERM. Also, if you use
                 the EGA version of LOD, your users are not _required_
                 to use GTERM. (i.e. using EGA on one side does not require
                 using EGA on the other)

         d) If you want to install the sysop customization package
            (which includes editors and sysop utilities), then unzip
            LODxxxE.ARJ as well.

         e) If you want to use the audio support, then unzip LODxxxF.ARJ
            too.

   III) Edit the control file (GAME.CTL) for your bbs software, user name,
        etc. The control file should be self-explanatory.

    IV) Install the door into your bbs software (see bbs software for more
        information).

         Your bbs program will have to call the file "GAME.EXE" to activate
         LOD. Please see the section below on command line switches to see
         which ones may be needed.

 LOCAL) The game can be loaded from DOS with "GAME /L" at any time. You may
        wish to specify other command line parameters such as "/EGA" to
        enable EGA graphics or "/EMS" to use ems memory as well.

Command Line Switches
---------------------

     /L       Load in Local mode.

     /S       Sysop fast log on. (uses sysop name in GAME.CTL)

     /M       Force maintenance run. (Unneccessary unless "NOAUTOMAINT" is
              present in GAME.CTL)

     /EGA     Displays EGA GRAPHICS on sysop's computer.

     /EMS     Use ems memory if available.

     /Nx      Specifies node number. (i.e. /N1 for node 1, /N2 for node 2,
              etc)

     /Pyy     Specifies path to drop files. (i.e. /PC:\BBS, for c:\bbs, etc)

     /CHECK   Perform multinode check (see multinode use below)

     /Bxxxx   Specify lock baud rate. For example, "/B38400" would force the
              com port to be 38,400 baud no matter what the drop file (i.e.
              DORINFOx.DEF) says the baud is.

     /?       Display a brief command line option summary.

     /OVREMS  Will cause LOD to attempt to load its overlay into EMS memory
              if possible.

   /AUDIOSB   Will start up the audio sound system using soundblaster
              sound card. (Requires LODxxxF.ARJ)

   /AUDIOSPKR Will start up the audio sound system using the PC speaker.
              Quality isn't very good. (Requires LODxxxF.ARJ)

   /AQULTRA   Really high audio quality. Ought to really slow down
              performance. (Use of this keyword is NOT recommended - it
              may behave unpredictably)

   /AQHIGH    High audio quality. May slow down performance.

   /AQMED     Medium audio quality. default.

   /AQLOW     Low audio quality. Should increase performance compared to
              AQHIGH/AQMED. May be necessary for some slower machines.

   /AQMIN     Minimal audio quality. If none of the others work, or
              strange lockups or hanging occurs, then you might want to
              give this keyword a shot. (Not recommended unless absolutely
              necessary)

     /FR      Play audio when remote users are on. By default, LOD will
              NOT play music on the sysops machine when the caller is
              on from REMOTE. This is done to not wake up the sysop in
              the middle of the night when a player enters the game! However,
              if you want the music to play no matter whether the user
              is on locally, or remotely, then you can use this switch.

Examples
--------
  "GAME /L /EMS /EGA"

      Loads LOD in local mode with EGA graphics active and EMS memory
      will be used if available.

  "GAME /N1 /EMS /EGA /PI:\MAX /B38400"

      Loads LOD in remote mode with EGA grahpics active. EMS memory will be
      used if available. Node #1 has been selected (i.e. DORINFO1.DEF or
      DOOR1.SYS will be used). The drop file will be searched for in the
      path I:\MAX. The baud rate will be locked to 38,400

  "GAME /L /EMS /EGA /AUDIOSB"

      Load locally, enable EGA graphics, use EMS if available, and use
      soundblaster audio.

Glossary
--------
     Here's the definitions of a few terms that I will be using quite
 frequently in this document.

     Baud - The speed at which the user is calling.

     DORINFOx.DEF - Common drop file used by a variety of bbs programs. It is
                    the most extensively tested drop file format in LOD, and
                    therefore, the most reliable.

     Drop File - The file that is created by the bbs program when it goes to
                 execute the door. It contains the baud rate, com port,
                 name of the user online, etc. Common drop files are
                 DORINFO.DEF, DOOR.SYS, PCBOARD.SYS, EXITINFO.DAT, etc.

     EGA - "Enhanced Graphics Adapter". The graphics standard that GAMEEGA
           and GTERM use. Most modern video adapters (VGA, SVGA, etc)
           also support the EGA modes.

     EMS - "Expanded Memory Specification". If your machine has over 1
           megabyte of memory, then you may have some available. LOD can
           utilize EMS to improve game performance and reduce conventional
           memory requirements.

     Locked Baud - In order to get the most efficiency out of a high speed
                   error correcting modem (9600 baud or above), then you may
                   lock the baud rate to a speed higher than what the caller
                   is actually using. By locking the baud to 38,400, the
                   modem can actually compress the data that is being sent
                   and achieve a baud rate much higher than the actual
                   transmission rate. Please see the section on high speed/
                   locked bauds below.

     LOD - "Land Of Devastation", the name of the game you are trying to
           install!

     MOD - A commonly used music file format. Most MOD songs are high
           quality four voice with digital effects. Land Of Devastation
           uses MODs for it's music.

     Maint - Maintenance mode. LOD must perform maintenance once per day to
             do various things with it's data files. See the section below
             on maintenance.

     Multinode - A bbs system with either more than one computer attached
                 or using a multi tasker (desqview, windows) that allows
                 more than one person to call at a time.

     Node - Refers to a member of a multinode system.

     Overlay - A file included with LOD (either GAME.OVR or GAMEEGA.OVR)
               which is used to keep portions of the program on disk to
               reduce memory requirements. It is all automatic and you should
               not need to worry about it.

     Sound Blaster - A common sound card that is installed in many computers.
                     The Sound Blaster card is produced by Creative Labs and
                     includes support for both music and digital voice
                     effects. Several other cards are available that are
                     "compatible" with the Sound Blaster standard, such
                     as the Thunderboard and the Pro Audio Spectrum.

EGA Graphics Version
--------------------

     LOD has been designed with _optional_ EGA graphics to enhance the
 playing experience. By default, LOD will load with just the plain text
 graphics.

     To enable the EGA graphics, you must use the "/EGA" switch on the
 command line. For example, "GAME /L /EGA". EGA graphics do consume more
 memory and may not run on your computer. If you have trouble, you may
 wish to try using the "/EMS" switch described below under "memory
 requirements".

     NOTE: By using EGA graphics on the sysop side, you are not "forcing"
 your users to use EGA graphics too. The remote user graphics are totally
 independent of the sysop's graphics.


Memory Requirements
-------------------

 NOTE: A runtime error 203 or 253 indicates insufficient memory!

     LOD can be adequately described as a "memory hog". LOD likes as much
 memory as you can give it. LOD's memory requirements differ depending on
 the configuration that you use.

     TEXT version (GAME.EXE without /EGA):

        The lowest possible memory requirements. No EGA graphics will be
        displayed on the sysop's side, but your users can still have ega
        if they use the gterm terminal program.

        I suggest running the text version if all else fails.

     GRAPHICS version (GAME.EXE with /EGA):

        Consumes substantially more memory, but gives the sysop a nice
        pretty EGA display, similar to what the user with gterm sees. If
        you have memory troubles, try using the /EMS switch.

     GRAPHICS and SOUND (GAME.EXE with /EGA and /AUDIOSB):

        Gobbles up an immense amount of memory. Using the /EMS switch is
        a necessity to give LOD access to EMS memory so it can store some
        data up there.

 What is EMS memory?

     EMS memory stands for "expanding memory specification". It is a way
 for your computer to use memory above the standard 640k that dos has. LOD
 is capable of storing some of it's data in EMS memory, thus freeing up
 more space in the lower 640k for sound and graphics.

     Most computers provide EMS memory with a special driver in their
 config.sys file - QEMM, EMM386, and 386MAX are popular ones. Most 386+
 computers have EMS memory. If you are using DOS 5.0 or greater, then you
 can type "MEM" to get a display about how much EMS memory you have.

     LOD must be EXPLICITLY TOLD TO USE EMS. For compatibility reasons,
 LOD won't use it by default. You must place the switch "/EMS" on the
 command line when you invoke game.exe. For example, "GAME /L /EMS".

     If you aren't sure whether you have EMS memory, then try using the
 /EMS switch anyway - it can't hurt anything.


Audio Support
-------------
     Starting with version 3.60, Land Of Devastation and GTERM now have some
 sound/music capability. Here is how to get the sound system to work:

     1) You must have downloaded and unarchived LODxxxF.ARJ into the
        directory where you are running LOD (or GTERM).

     2) You must use either the option /AUDIOSB or /AUDIOSPKR to initialize
        the sound system.

     3) Optionally you may wish to use one of the /AQxxx switches to set
        audio quality. /AQMED is the default audio quality which should
        work on most systems.

     4) If you experience lockup or hang problems, then you may need to
        switch to a lower audio quality such as /AQLOW or /AQMIN.

     Examples: (For Land Of Devastation - on the sysop's side)

        "GAMEEGA /L /EMS /AUDIOSB"
          Load LOD with Soundblaster enabled.

        "GAMEEGA /L /EMS /AUDIOSB /AQLOW /FR"
          Load LOD with Soundblaster at low quality, force music to play
          when remote users are on.

     Examples: (For GTERM - on the remote user's side)

        "GTERM COM 2 BAUD 19200 /AUDIOSPKR /AQHIGH"
          Load GTERM with PC-Speaker set to high quality.

        "GTERM COM 1 BAUD 2400 /AUDIOSB"
          Load GTERM with soundblaster at default (medium) quality.


 Notes:

     The audio system is relatively new to LOD and hasn't been fully tested
 and therefore might have some bugs. In fact, with some people's machines,
 it might not work at all. If you have trouble running LOD with audio
 turned on, then try turning it off!

     The audio system eats up quite a bit of memory (almost 150k). Therefore,
 when running LOD or GTERM, you might not have enough conventional memory to
 initialize the audio system and you won't hear anything.

     Having music active on one side does not require having music active
 on the other. For example, a user with GTERM might have music enabled, but
 the sysop might have it disabled - this will work fine - the user will hear
 his music and the sysop will have some nice silence!

     If you like, you can bring up a display of the current MOD system
 status (also shows any possible errors) by pressing ALT-3. This works with
 either GTERM or the EGA (GAMEEGA.EXE) version of LOD. The non-EGA (GAME.EXE)
 version of LOD does not have the mod status screen.


 Music system credits:

     The code that is used to play the MOD music in LOD was supplied by
 Mark J Cox. It's called MOD-OBJ and it's an excellent unit and I
 recommend it to anyone who wants to add MOD music to their program.

     Most (if not all!) of our songs were composed by Chris Azure.


Multinode use
-------------
     LOD does NOT allow multinode use. Furthermore, I have no future plans
 to develop a version of LOD that does at this time. However, LOD can be
 set to "lock out" other nodes while one node is playing. (i.e. Node 1
 is playing so nodes 2 & 3 cannot).
     This is done using the /Nx and /CHECK switches. /Nx tells which node
 number is using the door. (i.e. "GAME /N2 /CHECK" would be for node 2).
 And /CHECK says to check for multinode use.
     The start up commands for LOD for a 2-node system would be as follows:

     NODE 1: Game /N1 /CHECK

     NODE 2: Game /N2 /CHECK

     When LOD encounters another player trying to play while one is already
 playing it will spew out the file "LODLOK.TXT" to the user to explain the
 situation to him.

     NOTE: Apparently, there is some kind of "glitch" in either Turbo Pascal
           or DOS which causes "sharing violations" to occur when LOD is
           activated by more than one person. If you have this problem, then
           you may wish to try to set the "read-only" bit on the executable
           files (i.e. GAME.EXE,GAME.OVR,GAMEEGA.EXE,GAMEEGA.OVR).

           You can do this by typing the following: "ATTRIB +R GAME.EXE".


Common Problems (Locked Bauds, High Speed modems, Music, etc)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: If you are having a communications-related problem, and you are
        not using a fossil driver, then I suggest you try using a fossil
        if it is possible.

     If you are running a high speed modem (9600 baud or above), then I
  suggest you run your bbs/mailer/doors at a locked baud rate. On high
  speed error correcting modems, locking the baud rate will have a noticeable
  increase on the speed of text that is sent. It's beyond the scope of
  these docs to discuss configuring your bbs and mailer for a locked baud
  rate; you may wish consult those docs for information on that. Here
  are a few things to keep in mind when setting up LOD with a locked
  baud rate:

     #1: You may need to use the /B switch on the LOD command line to specify
         the locked baud. For 19,200 this would be "/B19200" and for 38,400
         this would be "/B38400". Please note there is no space between the
         /B and the baud rate. This is only necessary in some instances. First
         try LOD without the switch and then add the switch and see what
         happens.

     #2: When using a locked baud rate, I highly recommend using a FOSSIL
         driver. In fact, I don't even know if LOD will work at high speeds
         without one. BNU is a good fossil driver which can even be loaded
         and unloaded before/after you run LOD.

     #3: If you are using a fossil, then make sure to tell the fossil that
         the port is locked. For BNU, to lock com1: at 38,400, you would
         use something like "L0=38400" on BNU's command line.

     #4: Please note: If you lock the baud for one program, it must be locked
         for everything. You can't lock the baud for just LOD, but not
         your bbs/mailer.

     If you are running at high speeds without locking the baud rate, then
  LOD should function fine. Without a locked baud, there should be no need
  for the use of the /Bxxxx switch.

     What follows is some information on possible strange situations that
  may occur:

     #1: Low speed users can play LOD, but high speed users get garbage.

             - If you are not using the DORINFOx.DEF or DOOR.SYS drop file
               then you may wish to find a converter program to convert
               whatever drop file your bbs produces to the DORINFOx.DEF
               or DOOR.SYS format and tell LOD to use that.

               Several converter programs are readily available on most
               bbs systems. QKDoor is a good one if you can find it.

             - If you are not using a fossil (i.e. you have LOD's "internal"
               line un commented in GAME.CTL), then I suggest trying a fossil.

     #2: High speed users can play LOD, but low speed users get garbage.

             - You may be specifying the /Bxxxx parameter when you don't
               need to. Only use /Bxxxx if you are using LOD with a locked
               baud rate.

     #3: Everyone gets garbage!

             - You may be using the /Bxxxx parameter when it's not needed,
               or you may have the the wrong baud rate specified in the
               /Bxxxx parameter.

             - Try switching to DORINFOx.DEF as described in #1 above.

             - Try using a fossil (make sure the "INTERNAL" line in
               GAME.CTL is commented out.

     #4: LOD hangs up when a user enters the game.

             - Sounds like LOD is getting the wrong baud rate somehow.
               Try switching over to the DORINFOx.DEF drop file method
               if possible.

     #5: Text and screens are getting cut off.

             - If you are running with a locked baud, then this could
               be caused by some sort of FLOW CONTROL problem. Try using
               a fossil if you aren't already.

     General trouble shooting hints: The following may help you clear up
  some of the problems outlined above:

     #1: You can use the ALT-D command in the EGA (GAMEEGA.EXE) version
         of LOD or the ALT-I command in the normal (GAME.EXE) version of
         LOD to get a display of the current serial port setup.

         If what is displayed differs greatly from what it should be,
         then you've found your problem!

     #2: If you're using something other than the DORINFOx.DEF drop file,
         then I always suggest trying to use DORINFOx.DEF if possible. It is
         the most reliable method and has had the most testing.

     Problems related to the sound system:

     #1: When remote users log on and the /FR option is enabled, the system
         hangs.

               a) Try switching to a lower (or higher?) sound quality such
                  as /AQLOW or /AQMIN.

               b) Remove the /FR option (you probably don't want music
                  playing while remote users are on anyway)

     #2: Whenever I use sound (with the /AUDIOSB or /AUDIOSPKR) options, LOD
         locks up in the game.

               a) Try switching to a lower (or higher?) sound quality such
                  as /AQLOW or /AQMIN.

               b) If sound keeps locking up your computer, then you may
                  have to simply not use the sound capability. There are
                  huge variations in computer hardware, sound cards in
                  particular and LOD just isn't compatible with everything.

     #3: The PC-Speaker sounds horrible.

               a) If you have a sound card, try using it - that's what it is
                  for!

               b) The PC-Speaker was never designed for playing high-quality
                  sound. If you don't like the noise it makes, then turn off
                  LOD's sound system!

     #4: LOD Starts up, starts playing the first song, and immediately locks
         up while allowing the song to continue playing.

               a) Switch to a lower sound quality! (/AQLOW, /AQMIN, etc).

               b) If sound keeps locking up your computer, then you may
                  have to simply not use the sound capability. There are
                  huge variations in computer hardware, sound cards in
                  particular and LOD just isn't compatible with everything.

Restarting the Game
-------------------
     Simply delete all of the *.DAT files. (DO NOT DELETE ANY *.DEF files)

     There is a provision in the game for the users to reset the game
 themselves when all of the puritron parts have been retrieved. But, if your
 users do not reset the game themselves, then the above method will work.

     If you want to configure with another Data Set, then see the section
 on Data Sets below.


Alternate Data Sets
-------------------
     With recent versions of LOD, I have put into effect the concept of data
 sets. A Data Set includes it's own maps, monsters, NPCs, cities, and other
 items. Most Data Sets are written by sysops who like to customize LOD.
 Information on creating custom data sets is contained in LODxxxE.ARJ.

     I have requested that game designers follow a standardized naming
 convention for LOD data sets. The format is a four character name followed
 by the version number of LOD that it was written for. For example,
 FUTR361.ARJ would be for the "future" data set, compiled for LOD version
 3.61.

     IMPORTANT! When switching to a new data set, you will probably need
 to re-start the LOD game (by deleting *.DAT). Most new data sets include
 an entirely new map and possibly new inventory items. Just dropping
 a new data set into an existing game could really screw things up.

     To install an alternate data set, just unzip the file into your LOD
 directory and over-write and existing files. Most likely you'll see a
 GAME.DEF be unzipped and possibly a ANSI.DEF or a GTSTRS.DEF. Remember,
 you'll probably need to restart the game by deleting *.dat.

     A few important notes about Data Sets:

     1) Installing a data set for an old version of LOD into a new version
        may not work. For example, installing FUTR361a.arj into LOD version
        4.00 could cause some strange problems. When you upgrade your
        version of LOD, you may wish to contact the author of the Data
        Set and request a newer copy.

     2) Installing a new data set into an old version of LOD may also
        cause trouble.


     3) You will probably need to restart (delete *.DAT) when switching
        to a new data set.


Unfinished Things
-----------------
     There are a lot of things that I really wanted to get done for this
version, but I just didn't get time. College is really taking up a lot of
time this semester and it's been hard to get time to work on LOD.
     Anyways, here is what isn't done:

     - Multiple grenade packs.

     - Several more special quests.

     - I wanted to add some more time limit stuff - 2-minute log off warnings,
       daily time limit features, etc, but I just didn't get the chance
       to finish them up for this version.

     - Multiple level maps - you walk into the nuclear missile base and
       there is a whole map to it, not just a menu.

     These are not things that are DISABLED, but rather are things which just
aren't completed. Most of them are at least partly enabled, but not fully
yet.
     I plan to work on these pretty soon - probably either version 4.10 or
5.00 depending on how many more enhancements I am able to complete.
     Also, remember, the more donations, the more incentive for me to get
this game finished! (grin)


Error Codes
-----------
       4    -  Too many open files (try adjusting the FILES= line in your
               config.sys file)

     100    -  Read past end of file. Something has gone wrong in one of
               the LOD data files. Please see "corrupted data files"
               below.

     200    -  Division by zero.

     203    -  Insufficient memory.

     252    -  Error while accessing EMS driver.

     253    -  Insufficient memory.

     254    -  Programming error [EAalloc block request > 16k]. This
               shouldn't happen!


"Corrupted" data files
----------------------
     It is possible that something could happen to your LOD data files. A
power outage, LOD crash, or other event could damage one of the data
files. For most of the files, LOD will display a "Data file is corrupted"
and the name of the file.
     If you get one of these messages, then the best thing to do is start
the game over with a clean copy of LOD.
     There are a few files which LOD can re-generate itself. CASSTATS.DAT
and DAYSTATS.DAT. If one of these is corrupted, then you can simply delete
the file and LOD will re-create it for you.


Revision History
----------------
    Version 3.70   - Added a new rom: Bartalk

                   - Added some monsters submitted by Chris Azure.

                   - Fixed a possible lock-up bug.

                   - Removed some redundant code which was using
                     up memory.

                   - Fixed some bugs in the trivia system.

                   - The game was not deleting messages when a game
                     is won. This has been fixed.

                   - Critical runtime errors are now logged to the
                     file "LODERROR.LOG".

                   - When the puritron is activated, the wasteland
                     will be "cleansed", turning all radiation and
                     wastelands into plains and forrest.

                   - Compiled with the new 7.0 version of Turbo
                     Pascal.

                   - Added some really big fortress stuff for people
                     who have the money!

                   - There is now a shorter long range combat menu
                     for people who have expert mode turned on.

                   - An option to dump the device definitions to
                     a text file has been added to Custom.exe.

                   - Xebocs Quantum Field is now armor, as it was
                     originally intended to be!

                   - The character sheet display has been
                     improved so it looks a bit better. Users who
                     prefer the older display may use the ANSI
                     options menu in the troop quarters to change
                     it.

                   - MAJOR changes to compile.exe. Almost all of
                     the .TXT files are now compiled to only
                     one file: GAME.DEF. See the above
                     sections on editing/customization for more
                     information.

                   - The docs on using the editor have been hacked
                     out and thrown into CUSTOM.DOC which is now
                     contained in LODxxxE.ARJ.

                   - Registration message modified to be gender
                     inspecific.

                   - Added a few images by Rick Armstrong.

                   - Fixed a possible problem with the DISINT
                     keyword in monster.txt.

                   - Added a new type of mines: Zapper mines which
                     drain a persons ammo.

                   - Mines may no longer be picked up (or killed)
                     without detonating.

                   - Removed all names but my own from title
                     screens 1-10. I have created a title screen
                     #11 which will include all the names of the
                     people who contribute to LOD.

                   - Fixed a possible bug in the /FR command line
                     option.

                   - Fortress owners are now allowed into forts
                     without a password requirement.

                   - The text strings used in the graphical screens
                     are now definable in GTSTRS.DEF for both GTERM
                     and GAMEEGA.

                   - Terrain types expanded to 50.

                   - Authenticity verification removed... It was
                     doing more harm than good.

                   - Experience for monsters who are holding the
                     puritron parts reduced to not be quite as
                     drastic. Also, Xeboc's power slightly increased.

                   - Major overhaul of the main map. Several empty
                     spots are now filled in with the new lake
                     tiles.

                   - Towns now carry specific inventories related
                     to the town.

                   - Added Frost Bite and Kill, Inc.

                   - Attached a special quest to Freedom City
                     (city #2)

                   - Put pauses after city-special quests (freedom
                     city, DW camp, etc)

                   - The BBSTYPE LOCAL parameter in game.ctl has
                     been fixed.

                   - Added four new songs by Chris Azure to the
                     LOD sound (LODxxxF.ARJ) archive.

                   - The maximum length of the user's alias has
                     been dropped to 20 characters to prevent
                     formatting problems.

                   - A more verbose "fossil not found" message
                     has been added.

                   - Messed around with the ansi menu routines
                     a bit to improve keyboard response.

                   - Added fast GTERM option to ANSI options in the
                     troop quarters.

                   - Fixed a serious bug with the loan system.

                   - Fixed a problem with the Priest Of Loki
                     dialog.


    Version 3.80   - Fixed a problem with the miniraft no longer
                     working after CUSTOM.EXE was run.

                   - Fixed a bug with the base teleporter price.

                   - Fixed a problem with finding the overlay
                     file on systems where the path had a "."
                     in it.

                   - Renamed the MAXTIME parameter to MAXLODTIME
                     in game.ctl. Problem should be fixed.

                   - Fixed problem with CUSTOM.EXE not allowing
                     terrain entries above 30 to be saved.

                   - Major alterations to the way resource.002
                     works.

                   - Added an option under the advancement menu
                     in CUSTOM.EXE to set the maximum number of
                     deaths per day. Defaults to 3.

                   - NOSELL and NOSURR options added to monster
                     file.

                   - LANDWATER and WATERONLY options added to
                     monster file.

                   - Added lava rivers and the Cryo-Unit.

                   - Did some work on GMAPEDIT - should work better
                     now.

                   - MAJOR changed to VAR1 parameter for weapons,
                     mines, grenades, base weapons, and base moats.
                     Now support up to 999 hp of damage. See
                     CUSTOM.DOC for more info.

                   - Added robomines! Now located at Kill, Inc, these
                     are much meaner mines than before.

                   - A few more special quests. (Added a SpWeap ROM)

                   - Two more puritron parts.

                   - Fixed message system; should no longer be
                     double spaced.

                   - I raised the default price of the "Trasporter"
                     from 1,000,000 to 20,000,000 because I felt it
                     was too easy for players to buy them.

                   - EMWarpMine option added to dataset.txt - control
                     the probability that the EMWarp device will work
                     when player steps on mine.

                   - Players can no longer log on under duplicate
                     names of other players.

                   - When a player chooses the "Create Character"
                     option after dieing, any saved clone will be
                     lost.

                   - When uses the exc. teleporter to fight xeboc
                     and dies, he will now die properly.

                   - Loans are now properly subtracted from the
                     players worth in the rankings and financial
                     statement sections.


    Version 4.00   - Completely revamped fortress devices. Forts now
                     have eight "specialty" device slots which can
                     hold a multitude of fortress devices.

                   - Increased fort for sale slots from 5 to 8.

                   - Added Wanderer device to forts.

                   - Added Toll Station devices to forts.

                   - Added Factories to forts.

                   - Added Mine Spreaders to forts.

                   - Raised default experience levels.

                   - Lowered default monster exp points for some
                     zone 3+ monsters.

                   - May have fixed a bug that had to do with
                     removing the starting player inventory items
                     and having players end up with "UNKNOWN"
                     items.

                   - Fixed a bug that had to do with isreal monsters
                     not working.

                   - GAMEEGA.EXE and GAME.EXE combined into one
                     executable. Use "GAME /EGA" to load in EGA
                     mode.

                   - Redid the Sacre Base corner of the map a little
                     bit to make things a bit more interesting.

                   - Pylon key removed from Sacre Base supply
                     station. Now only available at Freedom City
                     and on a few monsters.

                   - Added device lock device to forts.

                   - Added anti-self-destruct device to forts.

                   - Added autoseller device to forts. (see Terra
                     Labs)

                   - Improved waitkeys in fortress storage room.

                   - Default standard account interest reduced to
                     7%.

                   - Default game account interest reduced to
                     14%.

                   - Default bank loan interest reduced to 20%.

                   - Rewrite of EGA scrolling routines; Background
                     colors now mostly supported in the EGA version
                     and GTERM.

                   - Expanded max # of device definitions to 350.

                   - Improved waitkeys in fortress.

                   - Major rewriting to the Fortress "Energy Forsale" and
                     "Medical Forsale" sections. Now, instead of only being

Where to reach me
-----------------
     I can usually be reached at my bbs system, which should be listed in the
 section entitled "registration" near the end of this document.

     Note: Since I am in college and do not have much time to hang around the
 house during the day, I prefer to answer all questions/comments via the
 bbs rather than my voice line.

     We also have a national land of devastation echomail area with the area
 tag "LAND". It is presently on the fidonet backbone.


Registration
------------
     If you or your users enjoy this game, then please send me in a
 registration/donation. I am currently a college student and programming
 my income is pretty scarce. To justify the time I spend programming
 and maintaining LOD, I really do need some compensation for my
 efforts. Donations of any amount are greatly welcome, but donations of
 $20 or more will be considered a registration.

     Due to my busy schedule (I am a full time student, plus I'm trying to
 handle a full time job), I don't have the time necessary to do all of the
 disk copying, addressing, mailing, etc required to send out updated
 copies of LOD to every registered user. In the past, I tried to send out the
 disks, but I always got behind, which meant the registered users got their
 packages late, and it lead to a real mess. Therefore, I have come up
 with what I believe to be a fair and efficient system.

     Here is what you do to register:

     #1: Send me $20 (or more!) in the mail. (Smaller donations are always
         appreciated, but I usually don't issue reg codes)

     #2: Call up my bbs about a week later and use the "Reg look" command to
         look up your registration code online. You don't need to be
         "validated" or "verified" or anything - you can get your code on
         your first logon.

     #3: Run the program REGISTER.EXE which will prompt you for the
         information and create lodreg.dat itself.

     When you have entered your registration code, the following will happen
 automatically:

     #1: Instead of saying "unregistered", the game will now say "Registered
         to <your name>".

     #2: The seven second delay and other registration nags will go away.

     #3: ACME Weapons will become functional.

     Included in the LOD distribution archives is a file called
 "REGISTER.FRM". This file contains a registration form which may be
 printed out and mailed to me with your donation. Filling out this form
 is optional, but it does provide me with some useful information
 about you and your system.

     Please note, under this policy I will not be mailing you a package in
 the mail. Please make your check payable to "Scott Baker" and send it to
 the address below.

     Please send registrations to the following address:

     Scott Baker
     2241 W Labriego
     Tucson, Az 85741

     You may call the following to use Reg look to look up your reg code about
 a week after you have mailed the donation:

     The Not-Yet-Named bbs (USA)
     (602) 544-4655  (USR Dual)    Fidonet 1:300/9
     (602) 797-8573  (v.32bis)     Fidonet 1:300/29

     Reminder: You WILL NOT be mailed a letter with your registration code.
 Just allow an appropriate amount of time (a week or so) after dropping your
 check in the mail for it to arrive to me and then give my bbs a call as
 outlined above. The process to get your Reg Code is really very simple and
 takes no time at all.
