My favorite isAdamantium Sword.EThere is a couple different Adamantium weapons they don'tthem aroundBhere - I found it out in zone 4 lying insand.äSupposedly, some ofthe Ronin out there use them.LONGJI prefer to use a gravblaster.

ELEMENTALS@Nobody really understandselementals. Rumor has it they are theFspirits of lost souls have been fused into a radioactive energy form.CSuffering terriblyfull of hatred, they lash out at anything nearsGthem. They come in several varietiesWind, Fire, Water, Earth, Ice, and5Storms. I was "visited" by one just before I retired.VISITEDG[Sacre reaches for his footabruptly twists it at a 90 degree angle.

Theylive withinlow mountains.AIR.The domain ofAir Elemental is ofbarren ws.ICE.Ice elementals may be found infrozen regions.STORMHNot technically an elemental, these "storms" persist inouter zones. RadBTornadosNuke Twisters aremost popular. These are many times moredeadly than an elemental.MONSTER=The w is populated by many different creatures. Most ofonesEaroundbase here are pretty wimpysome are even unarmed. But once youGgo farther out, things get real nasty real quick. What  do you want toknow about?	RAD HOUNDHCome on man, you should be able to take a rad hound easy. They're just a0beast - no real intelligence to them whatsoever.RATDThe Giant Rat? Another example of whatrads can do to things.

NastyçMUTANT?We tell people not to venture out intow unprotected, but someJjust don't listen. It's sad, but there's not much we can do about it.

Not much of a challenge foran ed adventurer.INSANEJYeah, it's pretty sad - some of our guys just can takepressure out there.IThey go completely mad. Nasty thing is, they have all of our training and,equipment on them. Make's em tough to fight.DROIDBThere are many different types of droids around out there. Most ofEthem are simple machines, but some liketerminators are cyborgs. MostGdroids using some kind of ironsteel plating armor. Stuff's useless formeyou though - too heavy.
TERMINATORIThe terminators are pretty nasty. Most people think they're machines withHHuman brains in them.äNope, they're all circuitry. The terminator's realFstrength is it's armor - It's got G-4 steel plating. Stuff's too heavyFfor humans to use, but most places will buy it up for a decent price -0it's hard to find good quality steel these days.WIDOWEThe Black Widows? I've heard some talk of a new gang out inmountainsFcalledblack widows. They're supposedly pretty nasty. Theyve got their@own enhanced weaponsarmor - WidowLance, Widow Armor, etc. TheirIweapons use some kind of enhanced energy pack called a "WidowPack". Don'tAknow of any s thatthe WidowPacks - If you want to use any widow*weapons, you'll have to locate  own ammo.RONINJRumor has it there are a group of fighters out there wandering from zone 2?to zone 6, according to some more ed recruits they are heavily@armedHighly skilled.
