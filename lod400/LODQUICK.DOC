             Land Of Devastation Quick Description

       Land Of Devastation is a bbs door game in which players
compete to save the remains of a world devastated by Nuclear
War by assembling a air-purifying "Puritron" Device.

       To make a long story short, this device was stolen,
disassembled, and now rests in the hands of several bad guys
who the player must locate and defeat. These bad guys as well
as the players are located in a "wasteland" of nuclear decay.

       The wasteland is similar to your typical role playing
environment. It's a large map with multiple cities and special
locations the player may investigate, mountain ranges to
navigate around, high radiation zones to avoid, etc. It is also
populated by a large array of monsters which the player must
deal with.

       A wide selection of objects may be purchased in the
cities or acquired in the wasteland to aid the user in his quest.
From exotic weapons and armor to the unique "laptop" computer to
destructive mines, there are over 150 different objects which
the user may encounter. Each one with it's own properties.

       Various monsters and an array of friendly NPCs may also
be talked to in the interactive communication mode. The player
can probe the monster for information which he may need. Some
friendly NPCs will also inform the player of "special quests"
which he may attempt to accomplish for additional experience
and special items.

       To create a bit of friendly (or unfriendly!) competition,
players may battle other players who they locate camped out
in the wasteland. Players may form into teams to aid them in their
quest for the puritron. Fortresses may be constructed to provide
trading capabilities as well as protection.

       LOD supports three forms of graphics. For the non-IBM
or low speed users, there is a straight-ASCII display. For the
IBM users, a full enhanced ANSI map display is available. And
finally, with the use of the optional GTERM graphics terminal, IBM
players may see the entire world in EGA graphics! All of the
inventory items as well as the map will now show up as graphical
pictures! Once a player has tried GTERM, he won't ever go
back!

       If the sysop has EGA or greater graphics capability, then
he may also use the special EGA version of LOD to watch his
players in EGA regardless of what mode the players are using!

       One of LOD's strong advantages is it's customization
capabilities. Included is a full editor program which will let you
create new weapons, armor, and other devices. You can modify
the game's parameters to make it easier or harder. You can edit
the wasteland map to add new locations or new obstacles. You can
create your own monsters as well as modify any existing monster.
You can change the dialog that monsters/characters use in the
interactive communication mode. With LOD's configurable string
definition file, you can edit almost every text message or
prompt used in the game!

       Well, that's about all the room I have here for this
message. The first LOD distribution archive (LODxxxA.ARJ) includes
the full sysop and player docs which should explain any additional
things you may be curious about.
