    This is a rather heavily modified Version of Lod 4.00.  In 
addition to the rather obvious cosmetic changes made to the terrain
display, and the addition of more "contemporary" weapons such as 
Katanas and Mac-10's, I also added quite a few more monsters 
(mostly the same kind of monsters but with different stats and 
weapons), Moved locations of various cities, More Isreal Monsters, 
more tavern people, and a whole hidden storyline.  (I also removed 
Kirk, and all references to phasers).  Basically, I also made it so 
you would have to sog it out with non-energy weapons for a lot 
longer than before, and slowed down the level progression a bit.  
But the rewards for going up a level is a bit more.
    You may notice that you have twice as many hitpoints starting 
out as you have in other LOD games, the reason for this will become 
quite appearent when you venture deep into zone 1.  So in other 
words when you get those 15 points for going up a level don't skimp 
on the Hit points.
    Also I adjusted the weapons damages to match the hitpoints. (In 
fact, The whole reason I doubled the hitpoints is so I could get a 
larger range of weapon damage to work with).  And as another side 
effect I doubled the normal amount of Medkit uses. And I made armor 
last a bit longer and added some more Contemporary armors, as well as
some older ones.
    Thats about it, So go out and explore and watch out for that guy 
with the Vehicle Stopper!
