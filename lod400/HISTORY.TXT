            The end is near. Those around me rush in frantic haste in some
            hope of saving their lives. But, they're efforts are in vain.
            There is no hope of our survival. I shall transcribe the events
            of the last few years in the hopes that someday, some survivor
            will be able to know our fate.

2001 A.D. :

  Dec. 5th  America is ahead of the world in energy production, but civil
            unrest has lead to minor riots and many strikes. Iraq has
            been evading U.N. Weapons Teams and has delayed their
            destruction of some Biological Warfare factories. Alliance
            talks are proposed between Red China and The Arab Nations.
2002 A.D. :
 
 Jan. 5th   Russia masses the remaining army is has and tries to regain
            control of the Commonwealths that were once a part of the
            Soviet Union. NATO warns Russia that any hostilities would
            lead to certain military action. Alliance talks have increased
            between Red China and The Arab Nations. Isreal sends commandos
            into Iraq for retailiation for SCUD missle attacks into Isreal.

 Jan. 17th  Russia moves with lightning speed and massive force and takes
            back several of the Commonwealths with a stunning victory. NATO
            warns Russia to move out. Iraq closes its borders and takes the
            U.N. Weapons Teams hostage. The U.N. proposes military action.

 Feb. 1st   U.F.O. sightings have increased globally, and some amazing
            photographs have been taken of a large space craft - these
            are being analyzed by experts now. American Civil Unrest grows
            more intense with the failing economy, riots have grown worse
            leading to 17 fatalities.

 Feb. 25th  Red China and The Arab Nations have formed into a complete
            economic and military alliance called "THE ASIAN RELIANCE"
            forces. NATO grows concern about Russia's stubborness to
            withdraw from The Commonwealths, British and German units have
            arrived at Russia's borders, and more are forth comming. U.N.
            looses it patience with Iraq and begins launching aircraft
            mounted with energy weaponry into Iraq and destroys several
            factories and other targets. One target turns out to be an
            Iranian medical truck bringing supplies into Iraq. The Asian
            Reliance grows wary toward the U.N., despites its many
            apologies.

 May. 7th   A UFO supposedly landed in the Arizona desert today, and massive
            ammounts of evidence have been found - except for the ship
            itself. It also appears that an alien was aboard, as evident
            of footprints left around the landing site. The Government tries
            to keep it under control but it leaks out and begins spreading.
            Riots have gotten very violent in the past few days. The
            Asian Reliance forces have moved into Iraq and has help beef
            up the defences there. The American Carrier, The USS Nimitz
            was badly damaged today by a surprise attack by Asian Reliance
            combat planes. Two other major warships have been damaged and
            three minor ships were sunk. NATO forces grow on Russia's
            western borders, Russia issues a warning for NATO to withdraw
            from its borders.

 Jun. 12th  As the huge fleets of the United States bear and the Asian
            Reliance bear down on one another, they stand poised at the
            brink of war. One move on either side and that would be it.
            The world waits. No shots are fired. The mighty naval fleets
            back down.

 Jun. 17th  A holovision speach by President Quayle reveals that an
            agreement has been reached between the massive superpowers. It
            took facing the possible destruction of the human race, but
            at the last moment, neither side had the guts to push the
            "button". Instead, they set up a holovision conference, aired
            their disagreements, and came to a resolution. At last, in the
            entire bloody history of the planet earth, peace would be
            reached. Plans were underway to dismantle the current nuclear
            force. And the money that was being spent on maintaining the
            nuclear amrs would be channelled to a new destination - a new
            frontier - the exploration of space!

 Jun. 21st  And that brings us to today. The recently gained optimism has
            faded. As I write these final words, the three main holovision
            networks have all aired news reports that a nuclear strike
            is on its way. As Tucson, Az is on the first-strike list, my
            wait will not be long. My only hope is that someone will locate
            this document and bring those responsible to justice. All hope
            for peace is now gone. Nothing will remain of thousands of
            years of evolution will be a nuclear scarred wasteland.
